# ReactDOM API

> ## Excerpt
> A JavaScript library for building user interfaces

---
The ReactDOM package lets you render React components on a webpage.

Typically, you will use ReactDOM at the top level of your app to display your components. You will either use it directly or a [framework](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/start-a-new-react-project#building-with-react-and-a-framework) may do it for you. Most of your components should _not_ need to import this module.

## Installation

// Importing a specific API:

import { render } from 'react-dom';

// Importing all APIs together:

import \* as ReactDOM from 'react';

Youâ€™ll also need to install the same version of [React](https://beta.reactjs.org/api).

## Browser Support

ReactDOM supports all popular browsers, including Internet Explorer 9 and above. [Some polyfills are required](http://todo%20link%20to%20js%20environment%20requirements/) for older browsers such as IE 9 and IE 10.

## Exports

#### render

Displays a React component inside a browser DOM node.

render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
