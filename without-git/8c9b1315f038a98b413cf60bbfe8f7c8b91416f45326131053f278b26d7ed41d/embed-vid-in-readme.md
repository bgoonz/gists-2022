Add a url to video file in your ReadMe.
---------------------------------------

Github now supports videos, see more detailed answer here: <https://stackoverflow.com/a/4279746/1092815>

You can see a live example here (See at the end of the readme):\
<https://github.com/alelievr/Mixture/blob/0.4.0/README.md>

Github Pages
------------

I strongly recommend placing the video in a project website created with [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) instead of the readme, like described in [VonC's answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4279611/how-to-embed-a-video-into-github-readme-md/4279746#4279746); it will be a lot better than any of these ideas. But if you need a quick fix just like I needed, here are some suggestions.

Use a gif
---------

See [aloisdg's answer](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4279611/how-to-embed-a-video-into-github-readme-md/29842302#29842302), result is awesome, gifs are rendered on github's readme ;)

Use a video player picture
--------------------------

You could trick the user into thinking the video is on the readme page with a picture. It sounds like an ad trick, it's not perfect, but it works and it's funny ;).

Example:

```
[![Watch the video](https://i.imgur.com/vKb2F1B.png)](https://youtu.be/vt5fpE0bzSY)

```

Result:

[![Watch the video](https://i.imgur.com/vKb2F1B.png)](https://youtu.be/vt5fpE0bzSY)

Use youtube's preview picture
-----------------------------

You can also use the picture generated by youtube for your video.

For youtube urls in the form of:

```
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=<VIDEO ID>
https://youtu.be/<VIDEO URL>

```

The [preview urls](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2068344/how-do-i-get-a-youtube-video-thumbnail-from-the-youtube-api) are in the form of:

```
https://img.youtube.com/vi/<VIDEO ID>/maxresdefault.jpg
https://img.youtube.com/vi/<VIDEO ID>/hqdefault.jpg

```

Example:

```
[![Watch the video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/T-D1KVIuvjA/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/T-D1KVIuvjA)

```

Result:

[![Watch the video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/T-D1KVIuvjA/maxresdefault.jpg)](https://youtu.be/T-D1KVIuvjA)

Use asciinema
-------------

If your use case is something that runs in a terminal, [asciinema](https://asciinema.org/) lets you record a terminal session and has nice markdown embedding.

Hit share button and copy the markdown snippet.

Example:

```
[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/113463.png)](https://asciinema.org/a/113463)

```

Result:

[![asciicast](https://i.stack.imgur.com/gHrep.png)](https://asciinema.org/a/113463)




> [Video uploads now generally available](https://github.blog/2021-05-13-video-uploads-available-github/)
> -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

> Video upload is now supported everywhere you can author Markdown in GitHub, including from the mobile app.
>
> Share demos, show reproduction steps, and more in issue, pull request, and discussion comments as well as on repository Markdown files such as READMEs.

As [Lauren Brose](https://github.com/labrose) (Product Manager for GitHub Issues) details, this can help:

-   Help a maintainer reproduce a bug
-   Provide context on pull requests for reviewers
-   Share how a feature might take shape
-   Upload your video from anywhere! (Uploading videos from both the iOS and Android GitHub mobile apps is now available to all users)

Note: as [commented](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4279611/how-to-embed-a-video-into-github-readme-md/4279746#comment119601516_4279746) by [Sancarn](https://stackoverflow.com/users/6302131/sancarn), [**`webm`**](https://www.webmproject.org/) (open web media project) does not seem to be *directly* supported.\
Although... as noted by [Garrett LeSage](https://twitter.com/garrett/status/1392524531080761349):

> If you change the extension from `.webm` to `.mov` (or just tack on `.mov` after `.webm`), @GitHub accepts the video and even displays it inline.

[Matthew Gregg](https://twitter.com/braintube) adds:

> Does `webm` play on iOS devices? This might be why they soft block.

Update Feb. 2021, as noted by [Abhishek Singh](https://stackoverflow.com/users/9871400/abhishek-singh) in the [comments](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4279611/how-to-embed-a-video-into-github-readme-md/4279746?noredirect=1#comment117384408_4279746), and [Nat Friedman on Twitter](https://twitter.com/natfriedman/status/1365393828622921728):

> You can now -- finally! -- drop images and videos (mp4, gif) onto the Markdown file editor on GitHub.

> [![image and video](https://i.stack.imgur.com/vxyiV.gif)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/vxyiV.gif)
>
> Paste works too, if you're into that kind of thing.\
> It's worked in issues and PRs for a while; what's new here is support in markdown files.
>
> GitHub Enterprise Server tends to lag [http://github.com](http://github.com/) by a couple of months, but it will get there in a future release.

[Kyle Daigle](https://twitter.com/kdaigle) (Senior Director of Special Projects at GitHub) adds:

> Currently, the file is stored as an asset outside the repository (sort of like an image uploaded to an image).\
> (Uploads to [githubusercontent](https://stackoverflow.com/a/39066549/6309) and stores it there. Then makes a link in the markdown to that uploaded image.)
>
> The team is interested in exploring adding the image *to* the repo too... would you want something like that?

[Sven-Michael Stübe](https://twitter.com/stuebe2k14) comments:

> I usually add the images to my repo. Especially if you host your blog as github page w/ a custom domain.
>
> But I think this feature would also add a lot of complexity. It's not a big pain to add the image manually. For PRs+Comments the drag&drop is more essential

Kyle answers:

> For the blog case (which is what made us think about image upload to the repo) you're totally right.\
> This type of drag and drop is helpful when adding an image to a `README` or other in-repo documentation though (when you don't want to upload to the repo).

That feature has come a long way since its [initial proposal... back in 2012(!)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iq0Kl4Snyg&feature=youtu.be)

Update Dec. 2020: see "[Video upload public beta ](https://github.blog/changelog/2020-12-16-video-upload-public-beta/)", which embeds video (embedding only, not link/reference)

[![https://i0.wp.com/user-images.githubusercontent.com/22751162/101841526-ebf6ff00-3afa-11eb-965d-5ce11efdb9f8.png?ssl=1](https://i.stack.imgur.com/3nUgq.png)](https://i.stack.imgur.com/3nUgq.png)

2010: The "[Github Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown)" doesn't support this kind of feature for any page:

An old support thread "Embed YouTube videos in markdown files" stated:

> With `pages.github.io`, yes, everywhere else, no.

(Note: as detailed in "[Github Top-Level Project Page](https://stackoverflow.com/a/15848761/6309)", **github.io** is the new domain for [user and organization pages](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages) since April 2013.\
The [page GitHub publication is presented here](http://pages.github.com/))

This could be a feature request like the syntax highlighting was.

For instance: "[HTML5 video in markdown](http://web.archive.org/web/20101211100309/http://support.github.com/discussions/site/1839-html5-video-in-markdown)" (August 2010):

> > Is there any way to implement a HTML5 video into the `README.markdown` file?
>
> Not currently but we might be expanding what you can do with the READMEs in the future.
>
> In the meantime, you can do this with GitHub Pages and our Wikis.
