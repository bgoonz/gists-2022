Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers, while those that do not end in 1 are unhappy numbers. Display an example of your output here. Find first 8 happy numbers.

### **Pig Latin** - Pig Latin is a game of alterations played on the English language game. To create the Pig Latin form of an English word the initial consonant sound is transposed to the end of the word and an ay is affixed (Ex.: "banana" would yield anana-bay). Read Wikipedia for more information on rules.

### **Watermarking Application** - Have some pictures you want copyright protected? Add your own logo or text lightly across the background so that no one can simply steal your graphics off your site. Make a program that will add this watermark to the picture. _Optional: Use threading to process multiple images simultaneously._ \* [[_bhaskar4n(python)_]](https://github.com/bhaskar4n/watermarker)

### **Turtle Graphics** - This is a common project where you create a floor of 20 x 20 squares. Using various commands you tell a turtle to draw a line on the floor. You have move forward, left or right, lift or drop pen etc. Do a search online for "Turtle Graphics" for more information. _Optional: Allow the program to read in the list of commands from a file._

### **GIF Creator** A program that puts together multiple images (PNGs, JPGs, TIFFs) to make a smooth GIF that can be exported. _Optional: Make the program convert small video files to GIFs as well._

### **Caesar cipher** - Implement a Caesar cipher, both encoding and decoding. The key is an integer from 1 to 25. This cipher rotates the letters of the alphabet (A to Z). The encoding replaces each letter with the 1st to 25th next letter in the alphabet (wrapping Z to A). So key 2 encrypts "HI" to "JK", but key 20 encrypts "HI" to "BC". This simple "monoalphabetic substitution cipher" provides almost no security, because an attacker who has the encoded message can either use frequency analysis to guess the key, or just try all 25 keys.
