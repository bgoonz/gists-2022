### 301 redirect

Definition: "A permanent redirect from one URL to another, usually from your old website to the new website. (e.g."website.com/about-us" now redirects visitors to "website.com/our-company" on the new website."1

Wood Street: Basically, when you redesign a website, some links will change. So, make sure Google can still find the content. 301 redirect rules give Google instructions for finding your new pages.

### 404

Definition: "An error page that a user sees when they try to reach a non-existent page on your website. Usually, this is due to a visitor mistyping the URL or attempting to access a page that has been deleted from the site. An effective 404 error page should communicate why the page doesn't exist and what users can do next."1

Wood Street: Users will see this page if the link they're using no longer exists. Create a 404 page that acts as a directory to redirect the user so they stay on your website. Here's our 404 page...

### Accessibility / 508 Compliance

Definition: "Website accessibility concerns making a website accessible by people with disabilities. All websites built should follow guidelines outlined by the Americans with Disabilities Act."1

Wood Street: Also known as 508 Compliance, there is a list of rules on a [website run by the GSA](https://www.section508.gov/). Basically, make sure that people with disabilities can access and use your website. So, fonts need to be clear and legible, images must be labeled for people who are visually impaired so the name of the image can be read to them. 508 compliance is still only "required" for government websites. That said, it's always a good idea to make sure your website is as compliant as possible. There are lots of tools to check for this. Your webmaster should be able to run a quick report to let you know what issues need to be resolved to get your site in compliance.

### Agile

Definition: "A is for agile, a major buzzword across the entire tech industry right now. Agile web development essentially refers to a particular way of working, and you'll often hear this term in the startup world. In an agile team, web developers will work according to weekly or biweekly sprints. A sprint usually consists of five phases: design, develop, test, deploy and review."2

Wood Street: Agile means you are developing and deploying features as they are completed. So, you'd launch with something much sooner and make adjustments and improvements to a live website or app. This initial launch is known as the minimal viable product/website/app. Agile is growing in popularity and is the preferred method of most developers. That said, it's not always preferred by clients who want a fixed price and fixed deliverables.

### Algorithm

Definition: "An algorithm is basically a set of steps for carrying out certain tasks. In computer programming, algorithms are a key part of problem-solving. When creating an algorithm, developers will document all the necessary steps it took to arrive at a solution to a problem, and what each step involved."2

Wood Street: An algorithm is a programmatic solution to a problem. It's the code equivalent to an instruction manual.

### ALT tag

Definition: "Alternate descriptive text that is displayed inside the image placeholder while the page is loading. ALT text plays a role in optimizing a website for ADA compliance [see above], helps with SEO ranking, and overall web accessibility."1

Wood Street: It's the text associated with an image that displays when an image isn't loaded or able to be seen. You may have seen something similar in an email before you download or show the images.

### API

Definition: API stands for Application Programming Interface. An API enables two different programs to communicate with each other by making some parts of the website code available to developers. Developers can use this code, i.e. the API, to build tools and widgets that can be connected to that particular website."2

Wood Street: Let's say you have a WordPress or Drupal website and you need your contact form to connect to your email marketing solution, say MailChimp or ConstantContact. An API would facilitate that connection. Whenever a developer mentions an API, they are looking for a way to connect two pieces of software for a singular purpose.

### Application

Definition: "Software that is used for business or entertainment. The terms "application," "application program," "software application" and simply "app" may refer to virtually any type of program from spreadsheets such as Excel to media players such as iTunes to virtual reality games such as Second Life. However, the term specifically excludes essential control software such as the operating system ."3

Wood Street: An app is a standalone piece of software. Google Chrome is an example of software that can function as a web app, desktop app, and mobile app.

### Back-end

Definition: "Back-end development essentially refers to everything that goes on behind the scenes. What happens at the back-end --- or server-side --- powers what happens at the front-end, i.e. what the user sees and interacts with. Back-end development can be broken down into four main components of a software stack: the server, the database, the operating system, and the software."2

Wood Street: Basically, if you cannot see it happen, it is likely a back-end function. For example, the interface where you type in a search in Google is the front-end. The back-end is what happens after you hit enter.

### Breakpoints

Definition: "The points at which a website's content will adjust to accommodate various screen sizes to provide the user with the best possible layout to view content. In responsive design (see term below), breakpoints are often defined by common device widths, such as smartphone, tablet, and desktops above 1024px."1

Wood Street: These are the sizes where a design layout will change, ie a desktop view, tablet view, mobile view, etc.

### Bootstrap

Definition: "Bootstrap is a free, open-source front-end framework for designing websites and web apps. It was developed by Mark Otto and Jacob Thornton at Twitter in order to encourage consistency across internal tools. Bootstrap includes HTML and CSS-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, tables, navigation, modals and more, plus JavaScript plugins."2

Wood Street: Bootstrap is a bunch of pre-written code that front-end developers use to turn a design into a functional website. At Wood Street, we have a similar framework we created to streamline our front-end development.

### Browser

Definition: "A web browser is the software used to access the internet and display web pages. When you type a web address or URL into the browser, you are effectively sending out a series of requests. The browser will gather all the different elements that make up that particular webpage, such as images, ads, and content, from wherever they are stored (i.e. different directories or servers) in order to display the page that you see. The most common browsers include Microsoft Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Safari for Apple, and Opera."2

Wood Street: Every device uses a browser to access the internet. When we ask what browser you are using, it is usually one of the ones listed above in the definition. We need to know this because all browsers are different and can display a website differently than the others. We need specific browser information so we can replicate the bug (see below) you are seeing and fix it.

### Bug

Definition: "A bug is an error that prevents a website or app from running as it should."2

Wood Street: When we are debugging code, we are literally looking for errors in the code. Sometimes a bug could be missed during initial testing. This occurs because some bugs don't reveal themselves until someone performs a unique action. That's why when you encounter an error, it's important that you recount the steps it took to get to that point and relay those back to us in detail. This way we can recreate the issue and fix the bug. Otherwise, it could be a matter of reviewing thousands of lines of code to find the bug.

### Caching

Definition: "A cache is a temporary data storage mechanism that aids in site speed by storing relevant information on your computer the first time you visit a website so that your computer does not have to reload that information each time you access the site again."2

Wood Street: We will often ask you to clear your cache when we've posted a change for you to review. The reason for this is, as you see in the definition above, your browser has stored elements of a website so they load faster the next time you go there. If you go to see a change and it isn't there, you'll need to clear your cache. You can do this by pressing CTRL/CMMD + F5 while in your browser.

### Call to Action (CTA)

Definition: "Specific text, image, banner or button that uses action-oriented language that urges a visitor on a website to act. CTAs are designed to move a visitor from one page to the next and persuade them to take an expected, predetermined action. (e.g. Download a Whitepaper, Register for a Webinar, Contact Us, Learn More, etc.)."1

Wood Street: A CTA should be clear and obvious. You want your most important CTAs to appear "above the fold." You can see two examples in this desktop view of a website we designed for JoJo's Restaurant and Tap House in Frederick, MD...

![jojo's call to action example](https://www.woodst.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/jojos-cta-1024x586.png)

### Code

Definition: "Code is essentially what web developers write using programming languages. To see exactly what code looks like, right-click on your internet browser window and click 'view page source.' You'll then be able to see the code that's behind this particular website."2

Wood Street: We develop in a few different types of code (definitions in this list): HTML/CSS, PHP, JavaScript, and jQuery.

### CSS

Definition: "CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a markup language responsible for the visual elements of a website. HTML (another markup language) is used to determine the structure and content of the webpage. Web developers will then use CSS to style this content; in other words, CSS tells the browser how the HTML elements should be displayed. CSS is used to apply colors and to determine font, text size and alignment, to name just a few."2

Wood Street: You may have gone to a website and it looks like it went through a "Way Back Machine." All the images are gone, the text is very plain, and the links are all underlined and blue. This usually means the CSS is not loading properly as CSS is what controls how the information is displayed. Without CSS, the browser will simply show the basics. Not all CSS is created equal. Some can be poorly written or bloated causing a website to load slowly and not display properly. Wood Street's CSS is, of course, good stuff!

### Content Management System (CMS)

Definition: "A software system that is used to edit the content on your website. This allows you to login into the "back-end" of your website to edit the text and images. Some examples include WordPress and Drupal. A CMS is designed to simplify the publication of website content, without requiring technical knowledge of code."1

Wood Street: Universal access to open source content management systems like [WordPress](https://www.woodst.com/web-design-development/digital-marketing-benefits-of-wordpress/) and Drupal have revolutionized digital marketing. A CMS allows an organization to make all website edits themselves. It's a time and money saver but, more importantly, it means you can manage your own content. This removes any bottleneck so you can be agile with your marketing efforts. If you have a CMS but do not know how to use it, get training. If you don't have a CMS, we highly recommend [upgrading to one](https://www.woodst.com/contact/). We have yet to find an organization that can't benefit from a CMS.

### Conversion

Definition: "When a user takes a specific desired action related to online marketing and lead generation. This includes completing a web form, submitting a request for information, subscribing to a newsletter or making an e-commerce purchase."1

Wood Street: You would use a CTA (see above) to drive [conversion](https://www.woodst.com/design-seo/). The success of your website will be, more than likely, dependant on how many conversions occur within a given period. This is the most effective way for you to measure ROI. If your conversion rate is low, you may want to consider implementing some CRO or conversion rate optimization.

### Cookies

Definition: "A small text file (up to 4KB) created by a website that is stored in the user's computer either temporarily for that session only or permanently on the hard disk (persistent cookie). Cookies provide a way for the website to recognize you and keep track of your preferences."3

Wood Street: Cookies have gotten a bad rap over the years. Yes, cookies can be used for nefarious purposes, but for the most part, they are used to improve the [user's experience](https://www.woodst.com/web-design-development/better-ux-compelling-new-feature/). Cookies can be used to reduce load times or to keep users from having to enter data multiple times. Trust us when we tell you that cookies are your friend. Don't believe me? Delete all the cookies stored in your browser and then talk to me after you've had to fill out a bunch of forms, etc again on sites you use all the time.

### Domain Name

Definition: "An Internet domain name is a unique name of an organization or person on the Internet. The name is combined with a generic top-level domain (gTLD), such as .com or .org. For example, computerlanguage.com is the domain name for the publisher of this encyclopedia. By 2019, there were more than 300 million registered domain names."3

Wood Street: A website can have multiple domain names but only one is the primary. The other domains can be set to point to the primary. For example, our primary domain is [www.woodst.com](https://www.woodst.com/). We have a few secondary domains that point to this primary, one of which is [www.woodstreet.com](https://www.woodstreet.com/) (long story). Go to that [second domain](https://www.woodstreet.com/) and then see what happens in the browser address window. You will see it redirected to woodst.com.

### DNS

Definition: "Domain Name Servers (DNS) are like the Internet's version of a phone book, controlling your domain name's website and email settings. When a user visits your website address, the DNS settings control which server to point them to."1

Wood Street: Please, please, make sure [you know where your domain is hosted](https://www.woodst.com/web-design-development/master-domain-name/). And please be certain that you've set the account to "auto-renew." We've seen too many companies either lose track of their login, or the account was setup with an ex-employee's Yahoo email. This is how you lose your domain. Take this seriously as it is the #1 way that people find your company. Here's a [useful article on DNS](https://www.woodst.com/web-design-development/master-domain-name/).

### Dots per inch (DPI)

Definition: "DPI is used to measure the resolution of an image both on screen and in print. As the name suggests, the DPI measures how many dots fit into a linear inch. Therefore, the higher the DPI, the more detail can be shown in an image. It should be noted that DPI is not dots per square inch. Since a 600 dpi printer can print 600 dots both horizontally and vertically per inch, it actually prints 360,000 (600 x 600) dots per square inch."4

Wood Street: Oftentimes we will ask you for "high-resolution images." This is what we're referring to. So, even though the web only requires 72 DPI images, we prefer to start with 300 DPI images so we have enough space/resolution to crop or manipulate the image to work with your new website.

### Encapsulated PostScript (EPS)

Definition: "EPS is a PostScript image file format that is compatible with PostScript printers and is often used for transferring files between various graphics applications. EPS files will print identically on all PostScript-compatible printers and will appear the same in all applications that can read the PostScript format. PostScript code is used for storing font and [vector image](https://techterms.com/definition/vectorgraphic) information. Vector images are usually drawings created by programs such as Adobe Illustrator and CorelDRAW. EPS files may also include a rasterized version of the image used for previewing the contents of the file."4

Wood Street: As you can see, an EPS is so much more than just a graphics file. When we design your website or create collateral materials for you, we need your logo in an EPS format. We can ensure the logo will display properly if we start with an EPS. The graphic designer who designed your logo should have provided you with an EPS format of that logo design. If not, ask if you can get one and then store it somewhere safe that can be easily accessed by those who might need it.

### Favicon

Definition: "A small icon image, often a company logo, that displays on the title bar or tab of a browser."1

Wood Street: This is a small but very meaningful little piece of design. If you're anything like me, you keep a lot of tabs open on your desktop. So, it helps to have a favicon in your tab so users can easily go back your website when they're in another tab. Here's our favicon...

![](https://www.woodst.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/wood-street-favicon.png)

And here it is with a bunch of other favicons...

![](https://www.woodst.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/favicons.png)

### Fluid Layout

Definition: "A fluid layout is a type of webpage design in which layout of the page resizes as the window size is changed. This is accomplished by defining areas of the page using percentages instead of fixed pixel widths."4

Wood Street: We present our designs to clients as a flat JPG file at first. Sometimes, clients are confused and wonder why the design looks different in various browsers or on different computers. Our explanation is usually something about this being a flat JPG and that the functional website will be fluid and fill the screen appropriately. This is what we're referring to. 🙂

### Fonts (True type / Postscript / OpenType /Sans Serif / Serif)

Definition: There are a few here to define...

-   TrueType Fonts: TrueType is an outline font standard developed by Apple and Microsoft in the late 1980s as a competitor to Adobe's Type 1 fonts used in PostScript. It has become the most common format for fonts on the classic Mac OS, macOS, and Microsoft Windows operating systems.5
-   PostScript Fonts: PostScript fonts are font files encoded in outline font specifications developed by Adobe Systems for professional digital typesetting. This system uses the PostScript file format to encode font information. "PostScript fonts" may also separately be used to refer to a basic set of fonts included as standards in the PostScript system, such as Times, Helvetica and Avant-Garde.5
-   OpenType Fonts: OpenType is a file format for scalable (outline) font files that extends the existing TrueType font file format used by Microsoft Windows and Apple Macintosh operating systems. OpenType was developed jointly by Microsoft and Adobe and allows an Adobe postscript file to be part of a TrueType font file.5
-   Serif and San Serif: In typography, a serif is a small line or stroke regularly attached to the end of a larger stroke in a letter or symbol within a particular font or family of fonts. Times New Roman is a serif font. Arial is a sans serif font.6

Wood Street: We included all of these different definitions so you understand how complex typography can be. This is just scratching the surface. For most of our websites, we use Google Fonts unless the client has a specific request. Some clients will have purchased the rights to use a specific group of fonts so that their website can [stay on brand](https://www.woodst.com/graphic-design-marketing/do-all-businesses-need-a-branding-guide/).

### (The) Fold (or Above the Fold)

Definition: Above the fold is also used in website design (along with "above the scroll") to refer to the portion of the webpage that is visible without scrolling. As screen sizes vary drastically there is no set definition for the number of pixels that define the fold.5

Wood Street: The fold is literally a moving target. A "fold" on a person's computer screen may be completely different on someone else's. Remember, *users will scroll.* If you focus too much on getting things "above the fold" you may miss some users who scroll automatically and zoom right past your targeted content. Instead, focus on the user experience and use design and technology to drive conversion instead of thinking of your website as a newspaper... because that's where the term "the fold" comes from. Get with the times, man.

After I wrote this I came across a post on Facebook that is just perfect.

![order-information-read-online](https://www.woodst.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/64391960_10219819000413858_7532010999407181824_n.jpg)

When you are scrolling through a website, this is how it goes. Think about things in terms of weight and visibility and less about ordering.

### Frameworks

Definition: "Frameworks were invented to make the process of building a website faster and easier. You can think of a framework as a collection of solutions, tools, and components that you can access in one central location --- rather than seeking them all out separately each time. Some common frameworks include Ruby on Rails, Bootstrap, and AngularJS."2

Wood Street: We use Laravel for a lot of our larger builds. For the front-end (see below), we actually have our own internal framework which helps to speed up development. That said, we can develop in Bootstrap if desired. Bootstrap is a front-end framework. It helps to know your project framework in the event that you need to move from one developer to another. For example, your developer quit, or joined the circus, or went on a Magic The Gathering Quest and is no longer servicing your custom application. A new developer may ask what framework the application was built in. Knowing this answer will help speed up your search for a new team. And you'll be able to make a selection based on their level of experience with that framework.

### Front-end

Definition: "Remember how the back-end is everything that goes on behind the scenes, and powers what goes on at the front-end? The front-end of a website, also known as client-side, is what the end user sees and interacts with. Front-end languages include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which all have a hand in determining the visual output of a website."2

Wood Street: Front-end code is what makes a website a website. Without this code, a website would be nothing but a useless image or text with no functionality. Front-end code and frameworks continue to improve which is why it's important to [overhaul your design and UX every 3 years](https://www.woodst.com/web-design-development/how-long-will-a-website-last/), give or take.

### Graphical User Interface (GUI)

Definition: "It is a user interface that includes graphical elements, such as windows, icons, and buttons. The term was created in the 1970s to distinguish graphical interfaces from text-based ones, such as command line interfaces. However, today nearly all digital interfaces are GUIs."4

Wood Street: GUI made computers accessible to everyone. Without GUI, only coders would be able to use computers in any meaningful way. So, thanks to Jobs and [Woz](https://www.woodst.com/wood-street-news/interview-steve-wozniak-co-founder-apple/) for putting that Xerox GUI to good use!

### Hosting

Definition: "The web servers where your website files are housed, served, and maintained. A web server is a computer running web server software connected to the internet that allows visitors to access a website through an Internet-connected web browser or mobile device."1

Wood Street: Where you host your website is very important. We recommend you host on a business class server with excellent ratings and super fast speed. If you host on a cheap hosting platform, just remember, you get what you pay for.
### HTML -- Hypertext Markup Language

Definition -- "HTML is the markup language that is used to construct web pages and display content like text, images, video, and links on the web.  It's often used in conjunction with other languages that allow the web developer to add functionality, such as CSS, PHP, and JavaScript."1

Wood Street -- HTML is the foundation of every website we build here. While it isn't necessary for you to know how to code or read HTML, it's good to know where it fits in the process. A website design is just an image until it's converted to HTML. This process is called "slicing." So, when we say we're going to slice the designs, that just means we are converting the designs you approved to HTML. We can then build out the rest of the functionality from that HTML.

### HTTPS -- Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure

Definition -- "HTTPS is the secure version of HTTP, the primary protocol used to send data between a web browser and a website. HTTPS typically uses a Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate to encrypt all communications between your browser and the website for added security."1

Wood Street -- Website security is super important these days, so much so that Google is labeling sites without HTTPS as being "not secure" in their Chrome browsers. They've already stated that HTTPS is also a ranking factor. An SSL is super easy to setup. You can [read more on SSL and HTTPS here](https://www.woodst.com/web-design-development/google-is-marking-non-https-websites-as-not-secure/).

### Header

Definition: "On a web page, the header is the top portion of a web page that contains the company name and logos. Contained between opening and closing <header> tags, this section also often contains a navigation bar to help users move between common areas on the site."8

Wood Street: This is not the same as the <head> tag. That is reserved for scripts, metadata, and other preloading elements. When we're referring to the header, we mean the top visible area of the design.

### HEX Color (HEX triplet)

Definition: "A hex triplet is a six-digit, three-byte hexadecimal number used in HTML, CSS, SVG, and other computing applications to represent colors. The bytes represent the red, green and blue components of the color. One byte represents a number in the range 00 to FF (in hexadecimal notation), or 0 to 255 in decimal notation. This represents the least (0) to the most (255) intensity of each of the color components."5

Wood Street: When we ask for a HEX Color or a HEX Number, we are referring to this six-digit code. The HEX digit allows us to properly represent your brand colors on your website. If you do not know your corporate colors, perhaps a [branding guide](https://www.woodst.com/graphic-design-marketing/do-all-businesses-need-a-branding-guide/) is in order.

### iFrame

Definition: "An HTML structure that allows another HTML document to be inserted into an HTML page. The iFrame is set up as a window frame of a specified size that scrolls along with the rest of the page, but the iFrame's content can itself be scrolled if it is larger than the iFrame window."3

Wood Street: An iFrame is not always ideal but may be the only way to embed certain content into your page. If you've ever embedded a YouTube video into a page or post, you've used an iFrame. It is an easy way to plunk (technical term) someone else's content into yours. If you have an option other than an iFrame which means it will be your content on your page, go with that.

### Information Architecture (IA)

Definition: "Information architecture is the practice of organizing complex information in a clear and logical way. In terms of websites and apps, this means creating a user-friendly structure that makes it easy for the user to find their way around. IA is not just for designers; developers are information architects, too, in the way they structure their code. Generally speaking, site maps, hierarchies, categorizations, navigation, and metadata are all part of IA."2

Wood Street: It's important to give IA some thought and attention when building a website. A site map is certainly part of IA but there is so much more. This is a good time in the process to bring in all [major project stakeholders](https://www.woodst.com/web-design-development/team-makes-website/) and have an open discussion about the user's needs as they map to the company's goals. This is the time for everyone to have their voices heard AND a time to really think through the user's experience.

### JavaScript

Definition: "JavaScript is primarily used as a client-side language, meaning that it is embedded into the HTML of a page and sent to the browser. Web developers use JavaScript to add automation, animations, and interactivity to web pages."2

Wood Street: JavaScript gets a bad rap sometimes. It's next to impossible to develop a modern site without it. If used appropriately, it can make the user experience much better which is also a ranking factor. JavaScript can be functionality like search auto-complete, modals, and lightboxes. Here is a [website we developed using JavaScript for filtering projects](https://www.wellsandassociates.com/projects/). While the purists would say that everything should be clean HTML, a little JS can improve the UX and mean the difference between a bounce and a deep dive.

### jQuery

Definition: "jQuery is a JavaScript library. jQuery basically simplifies the task of using JavaScript on your website by condensing several lines of JavaScript code into a single line. Rather than adding many lines of JavaScript code, the developer can simply take the "compact version" from the jQuery library."2

Wood Street: Anytime we can use a library to minimize the amount of code required to build a page, the faster you get what you want.

### Languages

Definition: "Languages are basically what programmers use to build websites, apps, and software. There are programming languages, markup languages, style sheet languages, and database management languages."2

Wood Street: It's not important that you know all of the languages required to build a website. What's important is that you understand that a good developer must understand and be able to work in multiple languages in order to build a quality website. If your developer is one dimensional, what you're delivered will be one dimensional as well. Quality websites with good UX are built using a combination of languages and frameworks.

### Libraries

Definition: "Libraries can save developers considerable time and effort. Libraries are stores of pre-written code, or modules, that programmers can take and insert into the code they're writing."2

Wood Street: Again, it's not important for you to know what the libraries are, just that they are used as a way to streamline development and to speed up load times.

### Meta Tag

Definition: "A meta tag is an HTML tag that is used by search engines [when indexing] a site. Meta tags store information about a web page, such as its description, author and copyright. Search engines use this information to categorize websites and display information in search engine results pages (SERPs).1

Wood Street: Historically, meta tags have been mission-critical when it comes to SEO (search engine optimization). And while certain [tags still play a role in how a page displays in the SERPs](https://www.woodst.com/web-design-development/seo-do-keywords-and-meta-tags-still-matter/) (search engine results pages), they are no longer mission-critical. [Content and UX](https://www.woodst.com/seo-social-media-marketing/ux-future-seo/) play a much bigger role in SEO than meta tags these days. A good holistic SEO approach is always best; that means covering all the bases ensuring you have proper meta tags as well as high-quality content and a great user experience.

### Minification

Definition: "Minification is the process of minimizing code and markup in order to reduce the file size. When creating an HTML file, for example, developers will most likely use spacing, comments, and variables to make the code more readable as they work with it. To minify the code once the webpage is ready to go live, developers will remove these comments and spaces to ensure a quicker page-load time (crucial for delivering a good user experience!)"2

Wood Street: Even though broadband access is near-universal, web pages are delivering more information than ever. Google has said time and again that speed is a ranking factor. And, let's face it, no one has any patience anymore. It's important to do everything possible to improve page load times. If you look at the samples below, you can see the difference minification can make (remember a website is made up of thousands of lines of code)...

#### Minified Code

### Mobile-First

Definition: "Mobile-first is an approach to web design and development that prioritizes mobile devices. Rather than building a website with desktop in mind and then considering how it might look on a mobile device, with a mobile-first approach, the website is first built for the small screen. Mobile-first means adopting either responsive or adaptive design."2

Wood Street: Mobile-first is gaining popularity as more and more users flock to mobile devices for internet access. Make sure you look at your stats or Google Analytics to determine what percentage of your audience is viewing your website on a mobile device. We [developed this restaurant website using a mobile-first approach](https://www.woodst.com/portfolio/project/the-tasting-room/) when it was determined that the vast majority of their audience was looking for them while on a mobile device. The important thing to remember is that [one size does not fit all](https://www.woodst.com/web-design-development/designing-for-the-user-with-responsive-webdesign/). Make sure the website is responsive so tablet, laptop, desktop users get a quality user experience as well.

### Minimum Viable Product or MVP

Definition: "The minimum viable product (MVP) is the most pared-down version of a product that can be released to the market. When adopting an MVP approach, developers will first focus on the core features and functions that are absolutely crucial. Then, once the product has been released and user feedback has been gathered, they will continue to build the complete set of features."2

Wood Street: MVP is often the goal when developing a website or application using the [Agile Development Method](https://www.woodst.com/web-design-development/ux-agile-website-development-practical-guide/). You focus on getting the MVP completed and deployed in the shortest period of time possible. You might also employ an MVP when developing using the Waterfall or some hybrid development method when development is broken into fixed phases. Each phase is completed with the development and deployment of an MVP based on pre-determined project deliverables. The benefit, in either case, is that you're getting something to market quickly and can start tracking user stats and measuring against marketing goals. This keeps you nimble (Agile even) and makes sure you aren't wasting time and money developing something your users don't want or need.

### MySQL

Definition: "MySQL is the world's most popular open-source database management system (DMS). A database is a structured collection of data and an essential component of most websites. A database management system is a type of software that manages these databases."2

Wood Street: What's important here is the popularity of this system. This isn't a popularity contest like in high school or spin class, this means that lots and lots of developers work with MySQL. Why is this important? You never want to paint yourself into a corner when building your website. If your website is built using a less suported DMS, you'll have trouble finding someone to support it if your web developer discovers their passion for basket weaving and decides to go on a 2-year basket weaving journey across the globe. It happens.

### Navigation

Definition: "The navigational elements that appear on a website, such as in the "menu bar" throughout the site. While this primarily refers to the menu bar located at the top of a website or along either side, it can also include textual links in the "footer" at the bottom of the page."1

Wood Street: We will go to great lengths to make sure your navigational system is appropriate and effective. Some may feel that this is overkill but we disagree. It's important to wireframe and even prototype the system with which your users will find their way around your site. This is their guide through your content. It can work as both the tour guide and the salesperson. Make sure you spend some time on this and think through the user experience. Also, this is not a time to get cute. Navigational norms are norms because vast swaths of users are familiar with them. The less your users have to think, the better.

### Open Source

Definition: "Software that is distributed with its source code so that end-user organizations and vendors can modify it for their own purposes. Most open-source licenses allow the software to be redistributed without restriction under the same terms of the license."3

Wood Street: WordPress is probably the most well-known open-source software out there currently. There are two important points to make about open-source software. One, with these options you don't have to worry about licenses to renew or whether you have "permission" to alter the source code. Two, there is a vast community of open source developers out there. It's usually best to ensure that you'll have someone to support your website or application if your developer decides to pursue that basket weaving dream.

### Operating System

Definition: "An operating system, or OS, is a type of software that enables the user to run applications on a device. Say you have a Samsung Galaxy smartphone; the operating system, in this case, is Android. Any apps that have been built for the Android OS can run on your Samsung. The iPhone, on the other hand, uses the iOS operating system and can only run apps that have been built with this in mind."2

Wood Street: This also includes desktop OS like Windows and Mac. If you run into a bug or error on your website and report it to us, one of the first questions we'll ask is "on what operating system did this occur?" We need to know this so we can recreate the error and find a solution. A website is built to function on many different devices using many different operating systems. If we cannot recreate the error, it's near impossible to find a solution. The more information you can give us the better.

### Page Speed

Definition: "A measurement of the length of time it takes to load all the content on a specific web page."1

Wood Street: As we discussed above and in other posts, speed is super important. Google has indicated on many occasions that page speed is a ranking factor. And when is the last time you waiting more than 5 seconds for a page to load? Make sure you are doing everything possible to improve page speed. And if your developer tells you that your request will hurt loading times, take that very seriously and consider alternatives.

### Page Template

Definition: "A unique page layout for the page(s) of a website. On average, a website has 8-10 page templates. For example, the homepage and contact page of a website look different and contain different elements, therefore they are two different page templates."1

Wood Street: There's confusion sometimes when we mention site templates. Some think that means we're using some pre-built template on their custom website. What we mean by "template" is a page layout we've created as part of a website theme that you can use to build a new page on your website. For example, if you wanted to create a new staff bio page, you might use the "Staff Template." Creating these templates gives you the power to expand your website without having to create something from scratch each time. And, if you need something new, we would create a new template for that section that can be used again and again. Efficiency wrapped in elegance. 😉

### Plugin

Definition: "Software apps that 'plugin' to a Content Management System such as WordPress to allow you to add new features and extend the functionality."1 "A plugin is basically an extension that adds extra functionality to existing software, such as plugins for your browser or add-ons for the WordPress CMS. Why would you build an app to support plugins? First of all, it's an easy way to add new features as it enables third-party developers to build upon the existing app, and secondly, it can help to reduce the size of an app."2

Wood Street: Plugins are great and have revolutionized websites and web experiences. If you have a WordPress website, chances are you can find a plugin to do just about anything you want. But, here's the rub. There are literally thousands of plugins. That's great, right? Yes, and no. Some of those plugins are junk. They were developed by a hack, are never updated, and could potentially cause functionality and security issues for your website. That's why it's always a good idea to have your web developer review any plugins before installing and using them on your website.

### Photoshop

Definition: "A popular high-end image editor for the Macintosh and Windows from Adobe. Photoshop has become the de-facto standard in image editing. Although it contains a large variety of image editing features, one of Photoshop's most powerful capabilities is layers, which allows images to be rearranged under and over each other for placement. Photoshop is designed to read from and convert to a raft of graphics formats, but uses its own native format for layers (.PSD extension)."3

Wood Street: We use Photoshop to design every website we produce here. It's just the gold standard for web design. Something better might surpass it someday but for now, it's what the vast majority of designers use. I bring this up because, like open-source software, it's good to have a vast community of designers and developers who are proficient in Photoshop. When we design a website for someone else to develop, we provide them with the layered PSD (Photoshop Document). This file makes it easy for them to quickly understand the designer's intent when building out the website's functionality.

### PHP

Definition: "PHP stands for Hypertext Preprocessor, a server-side scripting language. Among other things, PHP can be used to generate dynamic page content, to send and receive cookies, to control user access and to encrypt data. Why PHP? Well, it's compatible with almost all servers used today, it's fairly easy to learn, supports a wide range of databases, and it's free to download!"²

Wood Street: PHP is an open-source coding language. Lots of developers code in PHP, and we've discussed the importance of having ample development resources available. One other point about PHP, since it's a server-side language, it needs a server running PHP in order for it to function. This means that your hosting service needs to support and run PHP if your website is using PHP to function. On occasion, a new version of PHP will come out with performance and security fixes. Some hosting companies make this upgrade easy, others make it a nightmare (think cheap hosting companies who advertise a lot). Make sure your hosting company is the former.

### Propagation

Definition: "DNS propagation is a term used to describe the time period required for changes to your domain name server's settings to take effect. It may take as long as 48 hours for internet service provider (ISP) nodes across the world take to update their caches with your updated DNS information. If you are launching a new website on a different web server, some visitors might still be directed to your old server (website) for a period of time, while others will see the new website shortly after the change."¹

Wood Street: It's very important for you to understand this. When we move your site or launch a new site and switch the DNS settings, it can take some time before you see the new site. IT companies and internal IT teams will often place restrictive firewalls and implement server caching on your internal network. Basically, this means that you might still see the old website when everyone else is seeing the new site. The best way to see if this is happening is to use your mobile device on the cellular network, not your company WIFI. If you see the new website then you know that there is an internal block somewhere and you'll want to alert your IT support that they need to clear the cache on the server.

### Registrar

Definition: "The company used to register your domain name. Some examples include GoDaddy or Network Solutions."¹

Wood Street: Seems simple, right? You might be surprised at how many companies do not know where their domain name is registered. We had one client who was getting notices that their DNS was going to expire and thought it was spam because they didn't recognize the company. Well, someone snagged their domain and they had to pay a couple grand to get it back. [KNOW YOUR REGISTRAR!](https://www.woodst.com/web-design-development/master-domain-name/) And set your domain to auto-renew!

### Resolution

Definition: "Resolution is the image quality produced by a printer or displayed on a monitor. With monitors, the resolution is measured by the number of pixels horizontal by pixels vertically as shown in the picture. Printers also have a measure of resolution called DPI (dots per inch)."8

Wood Street: There are two different concepts in this definition but both are important. If we ask for a [high-resolution image](https://www.woodst.com/web-design-development/what-is-image-aspect-ratio-and-why-it-matters-a-lot/), that means we need more pixels or we need a vector image. All we're asking for here is better quality and something that scales. You can always work down from a high-quality image but you cannot work up from a low-quality image. The second concept has to do with [your screen resolution](https://www.woodst.com/web-design-development/is-your-site-making-the-most-of-its-resolution/). The more pixels your monitor displays, the more of a website it can show. So a screen with a very low screen resolution will only display a small portion of your website. Older monitors with 1200×1024 resolution will only show a small portion of a website. Better screen resolution would be 1920x12oo or greater. Also, use responsive design to be certain your website adjusts appropriately for different screen resolutions...

### Responsive Design

Definition: "A website that adjusts to the screen it is being viewed on, whether desktop, mobile or smartphone. Media queries are used to find the resolution of the device the website is being displayed on, then, flexible images, fluid grids and the site menu are adjusted to fit the screen."¹

Wood Street: Just about every new website today is responsive. We put together this [video on responsive design](https://www.woodst.com/web-design-development/wood-street-concepts-responsive-design-video/). I think you'll find this very helpful if you are struggling with the concept.

Responsive Design -- Same Website, Different Views

### Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

Definition: "Designing a website so that search engines find the pages easily and index them. The goal is to have a page rank as high up on the results list as possible or be on the first results page, or at the very least on the second results page. Search engine optimization (SEO) includes the choice of keywords used in the text paragraphs and the placement of those words on the page, both visible and hidden inside meta tags."4

Wood Street: SEO is something that cannot be sufficiently summed up in a 3 sentence definition. We've [written multiple posts about SEO](https://www.woodst.com/category/seo-social-media-marketing/) and there are entire websites dedicated to SEO. That said, just know this, make sure your website has good, useful, keyword-rich content, is fast, and easy to use. That should be a baseline for every website. Then, you can tinker from there.

### Semantic HTML

Definition: "Semantic HTML is the use of HTML markup to reinforce the semantics, or meaning, of the information in webpages and web applications rather than merely to define its presentation or look. Semantic HTML is processed by traditional web browsers as well as by many other user agents. CSS is used to suggest its presentation to human users. HTML 5 introduced new semantic elements such as `section`, `article`, `footer`, `progress`, `nav`, `aside`, `mark`, and `time`."5

Wood Street: This is not absolutely necessary for you to learn but it is a concept that's grown in popularity over the years. Basically, improvements in code and markup are generally made so that the web is a better place for all humans to spend their time. Semantic markup helps with this by streamlining code such that any device will know how to display something. So, if you hear us talk about HTML5, divs, spans, etc, we're just trying to make things better. 🙂

### SERP

Definition: Stands for *Search Engine Results Pages*. These are the pages served up to users when they query a search term in a search engine, such as Google.

Wood Street: Let's face it, it's just easier to say SERP. So, when we say SERP, we're talking about some version of the page below...

![SERP](https://www.woodst.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/SERP.png)

### Sitemap

Definition: "A sitemap is an outline of all the pages on a website. There are three different types of sitemaps: those used by web designers when planning a website, hierarchical listings intended for the human user, and structured listings intended for search engines. Web developers use XML sitemaps to publish lists of links across their websites, in line with Google's Sitemaps Protocol."²

Wood Street: This is such a great definition. We also wrote this [post about sitemaps and wireframes](https://www.woodst.com/web-design-development/smart-sitemaps-and-website-organization/) which will also be helpful. Either way, it's important to understand what a sitemap is and be able to develop one when reorganizing or redesigning your website.

### Slider

Definition: "A rotating banner of images that is sometimes placed on the homepage of a website. It is a "slide show" type format that can highlight different content and include images or video."¹

Wood Street: These have fallen into the "Love to Hate" category among web design and UX snobs. We still include these for some clients if they serve a purpose. It's a great way to present a few different pieces of information in the top portion of the website. But, just remember, the "[Fold is a Lie (an oldie but goodie)](https://www.woodst.com/web-design-development/the-fold-is-a-lie-well-kind-of/)" and people scroll. In fact, Generation Z scrolls so much that they will likely miss your slider every time. Instead, focus on eye-catching areas of content as they scroll.

### SSL Certificate

Definition: "SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) is a standard security protocol necessary for establishing encrypted communication between a web browser and a website. When a site has an SSL certificate, HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) appears in the URL and the site displays as secure. The details of the certificate can be viewed by clicking on the lock symbol which appears next to the URL on the browser bar."¹

Wood Street: That's the technical aspect of SSL but let's also look at the marketing importance of having an SSL. In fact, we dedicated an [entire post to SSL and HTTPS](https://www.woodst.com/web-design-development/google-is-marking-non-https-websites-as-not-secure/). Google is now marking websites without an SSL as "Not Secure" in their Chrome browser. They've also said time and again that sites with an SSL will get more favorable rankings than those without. It's [easy to set on up and they are cheap](https://www.woodst.com/contact/) so there is no excuse for not having one!

### User Experience (UX)

Definition: "The interaction a user has with an interface. From a planning perspective, the user experience is typically defined in wireframes, but every aspect of the web design and development process---from wireframing to copywriting to design to programming---affects the user experience."¹

Wood Street: We always tell our clients to "think through the user experience." [UX](https://www.woodst.com/web-design-development/better-ux-compelling-new-feature/), like SEO, is studied, written about, presented on, debated, etc. UX is also a ranking factor in Google. So, take the user experience very seriously. In fact, I would argue that [UX is more important than SEO](https://www.woodst.com/seo-social-media-marketing/ux-future-seo/) in terms of meeting your marketing goals. If you have a bad UX, you will not get good traffic, will not see conversions, and will generally have a bad time. Test your site with real users. [Understand your audience](https://www.woodst.com/seo-social-media-marketing/stop-marketing-to-yourself-know-thy-audience-infographic/) and build the site for them!

### User Interface (UI) Design

Definition: "UI design is all about the screens and interactive touchpoints that make up a website or an app. Swiping motions, scrollbars and clickable buttons are all part of UI design --- essentially anything that makes up the user interface."²

Wood Street: Sometimes UI and UX are interchanged when they really shouldn't be. UI is the system and UX is the experience had using that system. UI is [what we do all day, every day](https://www.woodst.com/services/website-design-development/). So, when we say UI, we mean the graphics and functionality the user is using to access information on your website.

### Vector Graphics

Definition: "The representation of a digital image as points, lines and other geometric entities. Vector graphics and "bitmapped graphics" are the two fundamental structures for digital images. However, vector images are very space-efficient compared to bitmapped images, and they maintain all their detail when zoomed in and out because they are rendered in real-time."³

Wood Street: Vector graphics are usually PNG, SVG, AI, and EPS file formats. You'll always want a vector version of your logo design so you can use it on a business card and a large billboard. A vector graphic usually has flat areas of color whereas a bitmap graphic would be something like a photograph of a person.

### Wireframe

Definition: "A visual guide to show the structure and content of a web page without any design elements. This helps to focus on the layout of content and hierarchy, without being distracted by design."¹

Wood Street: Wireframes are huge time-savers and very useful planning devices. Using wireframes to map out page layouts will make it easier to address all of the simple details that can often hold up a design process. And since there is no design in a wireframe, no one is distracted by colors, fonts, images, etc and can focus on making sure the layout has everything it needs in terms of navigation, content blocks, and information organization. We [wrote a piece about the importance of wireframes](https://www.woodst.com/web-design-development/wireframes-the-secret-to-a-websites-success/) if you want to dive a little deeper. Below is a sample of a wireframe we did for one of our clients...
