# swyx's second brain

this is my public obsidian store of resources and lists and stuff, available on:

- Github: https://github.com/sw-yx/brain (PRs welcome)
- Obsidian: https://publish.obsidian.md/swyx

These notes are "raw" - not a replacement for my personal output channels ([site](https://swyx.io), [newsletter](https://swyx.io/subscribe), [mixtape](https://swyx.io/mixtape), [youtube](https://youtube.com/swyxTV)), where I will continue to publish my more polished work.

## Rollup of my Lists

This repo also rolls up some of my older lists:

- https://github.com/sw-yx/launch-cheatsheet
- https://github.com/sw-yx/cli-cheatsheet
- https://github.com/sw-yx/awesome-dev-podcasts
- https://github.com/sw-yx/gpt3-list
- https://github.com/sw-yx/automation
- https://github.com/sw-yx/uuid-list
- https://github.com/sw-yx/awesome-monaco-editor
- https://github.com/sw-yx/tracking
- https://github.com/sw-yx/email-tools-list

Search around for their modern incarnations :) I have let my two biggest lists and the investing list remain independent:

- https://github.com/sw-yx/spark-joy for design resources
- https://github.com/typescript-cheatsheets/react for React + TypeScript
- https://github.com/sw-yx/devtools-angels for devtools angel investors

## User Guide

- I will rearrange and rename at any time with no notice
- The folders are named in [PARA](https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/) format - optimizing for:
	- P - nearterm projects i want to do
	- A - standards i want to upkeep
	- R - resources for stuff i like
	- Archive - for misc past junk i dont see myself needing anymore
	- not everything is public, sorry if your thing isn't on here
