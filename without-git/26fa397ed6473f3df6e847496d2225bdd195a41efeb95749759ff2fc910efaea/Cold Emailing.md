 "Hey X,

I'm a huge fan of your podcast. Your interview with X inspired me to start _____, thank you. 

As a gesture of thanks for all of the value you've provided me, I put together these 5 short highlight clips from your conversation with _____. Feel free to use them however you'd like.

I think there are a huge number of people missing out on your teachings and these short-form assets would be a great way to entice them to your YouTube channel.

If you're interested, I'd be happy to do this for free for your 5 favorite episodes, my only ask â€” if you find value in my work, would you be willing to record a short testimonial?"
