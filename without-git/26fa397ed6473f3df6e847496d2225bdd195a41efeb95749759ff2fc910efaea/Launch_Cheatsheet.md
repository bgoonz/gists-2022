## Required Reading

- https://writeusefulbooks.com/ from Rob Fitzpatrick

[Gabriel Mercer on the SPF podcast](https://selfpublishingformula.com/tag/gabriel-mercer/) adopts [Tony Robbins' Business Mastery roles](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/my-notes-tony-robbins-business-mastery-january-2018-jimmy-rex):

- There are three roles in creating things: Talent (making things), Manager (growing things), Entrepreneur (taking risk).
- Our parallel: Artist (writing), Director (run and manage team), Producer (marketing, networking, interacting with readers)

as solo product makers we do all 3.

[Chris Guillebeau's 39 steps to launch PDF](http://100startup.com/resources/launch-checklist.pdf) and [Podcast Ep 1234](https://sidehustleschool.com/episode/1234/)

- Prelaunch
  - Studio start hyping their movies a year in advance - let them know whats in advance, whats the release date
  - Set a goal - if you have never launched before (get first customer? whats a good number?)
  - Build urgency - true reason for timeliness or scarcity going into the launch
  - Remember [6 factors of persuasion](https://sidehustleschool.com/classroom/#chatra): [authority, commitment and consistency, social proof](https://traffic.megaphone.fm/CAD2380931227.mp3), [liking, reciprocity, and scarcity](https://traffic.megaphone.fm/CAD3368058854.mp3).
  - Record a video or audio message to complement your written copy
  - Write copy in advance, proofread everything, **check it on mobile**

[An eBook pricing model that resulted in $100,000 in sales](https://blog.asmartbear.com/selling-ebook.html) - How you price a product can have a radical impact on the revenue you make from it. My search for the perfect pricing model resulted in an additional $50,000 (a 170% increase) in revenue. Here’s how.

[The $61,392 Book Launch That Let Me Quit My Job](https://adamwathan.me/the-book-launch-that-let-me-quit-my-job/) - Within the first three days it generated $61,392 in revenue and gave me the confidence to quit my day job and work on my own ideas full-time. (You cited Adam, so you probably already read this, but I didn't found any mention to the email templates, so, here it is just in case)

## Advice

- Wesbos: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBlOxBQrP9I 
  - 5 parts quality content
    - pick something hard-ish, that they'd take a while to learn
    - no brainer value - is it worth it? need to convince your boss? calculate ROI
    - pick something that sells itself
    - solves a pain
    - evergreen - flexbox is done
  - 2 parts personality + reputation
  - 2 parts community
  - 2 parts good marketing
    - who is this for?
    - email is king - 4.2x twitter
    - Sell hard but not too hard - social proof works
    - Launch Price - 4890 already sold! live number
    - TELL THEM its good
- https://www.katedoster.com/7-key-elements-of-a-successful-launch/
  - Don't just launch out of nowhere - as simple as "next week email" or a launch trigger - webinar, challenge,
  - Bigger isn't always better - which will you actually do? Like really?
  - Be more excited for them then your product
  - Have an audience booster close to your launch (if you can)
  - Have some type of urgency/ scarcity
  - Email more than once--- seriously.
  - Have faith & leave room for miracles and fun

## Affiliates

- wesbos https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBlOxBQrP9I
  - offer high cut for affiliates. 2 week cookie.
  - the right people are key. 6-7 affiliates.
  - something shady with adblockers idk
  
- 5 tips referral programs https://sidehustleschool.com/episode/1360/
  1. build referral language into a customer experience, at every touch point encourage them to tell their friends
  2. setup formal referral program (money, discount, with a link) - beneefit can just be more of what they're already buying from you - so your costs are going to be lower
  3. combine ongoing referral program with special promotion - eg classpass always $40 if u refer a friend, but sometimes $500 if you refer a few
  4. make a simple ask at the conclusion of a simple interaction, if they're delighted - dont miss out 
  5. https://www.amazon.com/Referral-Engine-Teaching-Business-Market/dp/1591844428

## Bundles

- black friday deal with other authors. High value > deep discount.
- 4 day sale.
- 3 books + videos for 49, 20k in sales

## Podcast Sponsorship

wesbos https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KBlOxBQrP9I

- Find people who run podcasts that will vouch for your product.
- make it good: "wes did an awesome job with this series etc"
- shoptalk show - sponsorship was good

## Endorsements / Testimonials

> REMEMBER: Your Landing Page with 8 testimonials does not need a 9th. Kick out the weakest of the bunch. - Rob Hope

- use https://helpthisbook.com/ for reviews? (its new)
- give 4-8 weeks with a final week followup?
- https://www.amarketingexpert.com/step-by-step-guide-to-getting-celebrity-book-endorsements-forewords-and-early-reviews-for-your-book/
  - book cover
  - 1pg overview of book
  - early reviews/endorsements
  - table of contents
  - 3 chapter sample
  - prewritten forward/endorsements
- https://writersrelief.com/2015/02/25/get-book-cover-quote-endorsement-famous-author/
  - Introduce yourself in a personal way, then state that you’re asking for a book jacket quote.
  - Briefly offer the details about your book: genre, story, publisher, release date.
  - Explain why you think the author in question is a kindred spirit who might like your book. Possible reasons could be: you also like his/her writing; one of the author’s titles compares well with yours; or you both love and write about the same topics.
  - Give the author a deadline for the potential endorsement, but offer as big a timeline as possible. 
  - Let the author know where the blurb will be used. Will it be on your book cover, your author website, or both?
  - Don’t forget to say thank you!
- https://pithywordsmithery.com/2017/01/book-endorsement-quotes/
  - Email Subject: Will you endorse my book?
  - The introduction of the book and one or two of the best chapters, ideally put into one PDF that is marked confidential. (You should offer to send the whole manuscript, but don’t send it right away.  It could seem overwhelming to review a long document and be a turn off.)
  - A jpeg of the cover art, if you have it.
  - Step 1: Insert flattery while at the same time being genuine.  Bonus points if you can proactively help the person out somehow.
  - Step 2: Draw a connection between what they do and your book.
  - Step 3: Explain the project.
  - Step 4: Explain what you need and provide a deadline. 
- https://blog.reedsy.com/live/get-amazing-endorsements-book/
- https://onepagelove.com/requesting-testimonials
  - Step 1: Request a detailed testimonial
  - Step 2: Edit the testimonial, extracting highlights

Dear THEIR NAME,

My name is YOUR NAME and I've recently finished a book that I think you would be interested. It's called TITLE and it's DESCRIPTION OF THE BOOK. I've attached a sample of the book here to give you a better sense of it.

NOW, IN 2-3 SENTENCES, CONNECT THE BOOK TO THEIR WORK OR LET THEM KNOW WHY YOU'RE INTERESTED IN THEM OR HOW THEY INSPIRED YOU.

I'd be honored if you would consider looking at the book, and if it resonates with you, providing me with an endorsement. If you'd like, I can send you a full digital or paperback version of the book, whichever you prefer.

PERSONALIZED CONCLUSION LINE THAT, AGAIN, CONNECTS YOUR WORK TO THEIRS.

Thanks for your time and consideration,

YOUR NAME
```

Hi <author name>,

I loved your book <title> and found it enlightening because . . . ​<briefly explain>

I have a new book coming out this winter: <title>. It’s about <brief description, just two or three sentences>. I am in the process of gathering endorsements for the jacket. Would you consider providing a testimonial? I would be happy to send you sample chapters or the entire manuscript for review—whatever you prefer. Having your support would mean a lot to me.

Thanks very much for your consideration.

Warm wishes,

<your name>

<your website link so he/she can see you’re a pro>

## Community Landing Pages

- https://nesslabs.com/membership


**What they do well **

- The headline tells visitors exactly who the community is for. "Curious minds"; "Developers without an existing audience". 
- Benefit-focused copy that addresses member's tangible and aspirational goals. People don't join a community to receive features or attend events. They want to learn new things, increase productivity, or feel more confident. 
- Social proof through result-focused testimonials, real-time stats, community previews or videos. They show us what success looks like for existing members, and what we can expect to find once inside.
- A single call to action gives people a clear path to get started. Whether it's applying before X date, leaving an email address, or subscribing right away, we know exactly what step to take.
- ... and a personal touch. A community landing page that reflects your personality will inevitably stand out. Sharing a bit about who you are and why you care goes a long way in helping people trust you –– and decide to join your community!
