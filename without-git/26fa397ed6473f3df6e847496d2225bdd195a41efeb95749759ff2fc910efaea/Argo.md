- **Cleanup Time**: k8s tasks can be terminated at short notice, only have 30s cleanup time. Argo/Airflow run jobs to completion, take longer
- **Data management**: batch processing job with large files, want to keep working on the file but the processing might be stopped at any time (can mitigate with retries, memoization, pod disruption budget)
- **History** - Applatix 2016 acquired by Intuit. Workflow engine for K8S
- **Why ArgoCD**: 3 things:
	- Gitops - easy rollback, auditing
	- Cloud/k8s native - store resources, build controllers, k8s rbac, scaling
	- argocd adds multitenancy, multicloud capabilities
- **Usecases for Argo Workflow**
	- general wf execution platform from k8s
	- scale - thousands, tens of thousands of tasks
	- Kubeflow pipelines has argo wfs embedded in it
	- large files (gb range) - good first class integration with buckets on Azure, GCP, AWS
	- Infra automation - if ur already on k8s
	- CI - move off jenkins (edge usecase)
	- ETL, batch processing, general data handling
	- ecosystem
		- Argo Rollouts
		- Argo CD
		- Argo WFs
		- Argo Events
		- new product: Argo Dataflow - running forever - streaming/continuous workflow
- **What qualities do people like**
	- big fanout WFs, offload to cloud infrastructure that scales up 
	- reliability - bcause k8s ephemeral
	- easy to get started, dont need to learn a lot of new things beyond k8s, because know RBAC, deployment, pod, logs
- How Intuit uses
	- argo wf: just managed solution - just run the workflow
	- argo cd: one click deploy
- PreArgo vs Post Argo
	- ArgoCD and Flux ushered in GitOps on K8s as a norm.
	- Argo WFs - can check status of WFs via a K8S API, contrasted with k8s job (very simple, not massive fan out)
- How Argo Works
	- conroller backend - golang grpc
	- frontend - react, scss
	- on frontend - rendering library/suite of components in real time
		- push based, animated fronted
	- RESTish API first design, above gRPC
	- lean heavily on K8s informers - in memory representation of a cluster
	- k8s operators - listen to changes in cluster and react to them
- How to define an Argo WF
	- it is a k8s custom resource called a "workflow"
		- metadata: namespace
		- specification - some config for impl, garbage collection, what work it does and ordering
		- each task has a template
- Roadmap
	- infinite workflows
	- multicluster workflows
- Comparison
	- WFs: Temporal, Prefect, Luigi, Airflow
	- CD: Flux
