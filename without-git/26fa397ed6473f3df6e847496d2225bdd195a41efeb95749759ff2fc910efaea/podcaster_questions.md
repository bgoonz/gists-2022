interviewing as podcaster https://assets.holloway.com/editorial/images/stop-asking-questions/saq-convos-graphic-med-top-v1.png

- Start
	- "What's a win for you?"
	- I'll mention your project in intro, but lets build credibility first
	- Pre-ask the Shocking/Challenging questions - tip them off before
- High level
	- Stop Asking Questions - lead a productive conversation
	- Share why you're interested - give people reason to help you
	- Reciprocate - be open about yourself proactively
	- Use Icon stories - show them how their idols did it, let them draw comparison
	- Share higher purpose - join mission they can buy into
	- End on High Note - give people home run question they can knock out of the park at the end
- Tactics
	- "Wow it sounds like everything is going perfect for you"
	- "Because?" -> turn from what to why
	- "Sorry to interrupt but i want to talk more indepth about"
	- Stop asking superlatives - not "whats the most important X", but "who is one X"
	- Use double barreled questions - "Do you feel comfortable saying if you divorced your husband?"
	- The dramatic lowball - "you make 1m right?" - let them correct you
	- Seek out stories - tell me about a time when you...
	- Ask tough questions by putting it in person's mouth - "what do you say to someone who's listening to us and thinking..."
- During
	- Look for shoved facts - dive into them
	- Recover with emergency questions - "I have to pause and ask: what's your motivation?"
	- Let them talk: Prefer to be heard than to be helped.

## question styles

Never ask a yes/no question. Don't ask "Are you satisfied with your current provider?" rather "What do you like/dislike about your current provider?". The wrong answer to a yes/no question ends the conversation.

Favor interrogative-led questions over leading Questions. A leading question attempts to get the listener to agree or disagree with a premise you feed to them. An interrogative-led question often begins with the words: who; where; what; when; why.

Imagine the responses to these two questions:
- "Did you like the movie?" (Leading)
- "What did you think about the movie?" (Interrogative-led)
