Your Brain on Success Porn:
- Success Porn gets you to 80/20 everything and 100% nothing
- Success Porn makes you believe you can skip the foreplay of relationship building with the right idea, the right quote, the right mental model
- The Regret Minimization Framework sounds smart because what they actually minimize is how much they say about their real regrets
- Success Porn is shot from the POV of the one character that has the best outcome, sidelining others
- Success Porn sells billionaire advice to thousandaires and, when they fail, blames *them* for not believing hard enough
- Success Porn twists your definition of success to someone else’s definition of success, so your sense of self worth is subject to how much someone else thinks you are worth
- Success Porn makes you compare others’ highlight reels vs your CCTV.

# developer content trade school
- art of software gets less traction
- than how to React in 2021
- The fundamental problem of developer content creation: "How to do React in 2021" gets 100x more views than "How to write software so you can maintain it for 10 years".
- The fundamental solution? write one paper with main thesis and then apply it a billion times

# wrap parse not validate blogpost

# complexity inside
- simplicity inside complexity outside
- dan abramov argument about complexity
- cost of complexity - 
	- program size, 
	- compute overhead
	- leaky abstractions
		- providing pure data -> simple
		- ASTs -> programming model
		- happens when you have state and side effects
			- hooks
			- temporal

# stages of software engineering
# general theory of software systems
# software from first principles
- proof of concept and intermingled
- prototypical piece of software is a script
- then you have function - input, output
	- and method - input, side effect
- 3 stage engineering
	- data fetch/human input -> parsing
	- transforming/planning/auth
	- output/execution
	- similar to ETL?
	- similar to lexing compiler steps - everything as a compiler https://twitter.com/SeaRyanC/status/1334233376509763585
	- similar to SQL databases
		- query plan command
	- similar to CLIs
		- you can do dry run
	- similar to UIs
		- FLIP
	- compare to builder patterns
- complexity measure
- incremental rebuilds
	- dont do it all in memory
	- persist
	- cooperative scheduling
	- scale with workers
- configs and plugin systems
	- vertical slices vs conflicts
	- running user & vendor code - need to sandbox
	- smart contracts
	- beware plugins that change the rules
- link to jordwalke's thing about immutable representation and diff with structural sharing
- check: IEEE guidebook
- work loops
	- workflows
	- cronjobs
	- game loop
	- nodejs event loop
	- model vs reality adjustments - stop at convergence
	- ML - gradient descent on weights
	- ML - hyperparameter tuning
check - esbuild architecture
	- server -> infinite loop
- communication: APIs and protocols
	- frameworks - inversion of control
	- rpc 
	- foreign function interface
- concurrency - :shrug:
- logging and observability - throw off information as it works
	- build devtools
	- step through
- persistence
	- caching
	- queues
	- databases
- operating systems
	- programmable hardware layer
	- people write apps atopthis
	- offer syscalls
- decentralized systems
	- timer
	- consensus
	- trust 
	- conflict resolution
- ML - software 2.0
	- this could just be viewed as decision layer
	- but if you give it adapters it can fetch its own data
	- if you give it objectives then it can handle the side effects
	- at this point it becomes AI

# throw catch considered harmful
- catch consolidates errors by default. keep errors local and automatically separated
- theres no way to mark the difference between error and exception
- common practice to rethrow errors so you have no idea where the error came from
	- cannot nest errorarray
	- cannot add metadata


1. How do you measure success?
2. How hard is it to go back to full time engineering?
3. How do you choose what to work on? (blogging, internal evangelism, conferences, demos)
4. How important is experience with the technology you’re evangelizing?
5. What do you look for when choosing a role?
6. Why would someone consider DevRel over engineering?

Tech Ethics
Designing for Crisis https://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2016/01/25/designing-for-crisis-design-for-real-life/ 
If we believe that technology is powerful, then we must also believe that the people who wield it have a responsibility for that power. The medical industry has the Hippocratic Oath, commonly interpreted as “First do no harm”. The closest version we have is “the Computer Lib Pledge” articulated by Ted Nelson in 1974:
https://ethicalos.org/
Deontology vs Utilitarianism
Deontology: the morality of an action should be based on whether that action itself is right or wrong under a series of rules, rather than based on the consequences of the action.
Consequentialism: the consequences of one's conduct are the ultimate basis for any judgment about the rightness or wrongness of that conduct.
Preaching ethics to others

technology fundamentalism
- Innovations in social scalability involve institutional and technological improvements that move function from mind to paper or mind to machine, lowering cognitive costs while increasing the value of information flowing between minds, reducing vulnerability, and/or searching for and discovering new and mutually beneficial participants. Alfred North Whitehead said, “It is a profoundly erroneous truism, repeated by all copy-books and by eminent people when they are making speeches, that we should cultivate the habit of thinking what we are doing. The precise opposite is the case. Civilization advances by extending the number of important operations which we can perform without thinking about them.” Friedrich Hayek added: “We make constant use of formulas, symbols, and rules whose meaning we do not understand and through the use of which we avail ourselves of the assistance of knowledge which individually we do not possess. We have developed these practices and institutions by building upon habits and institutions which have proved successful in their own sphere and which have in turn become the foundation of the civilization we have built up.”

## strategy moonshots

A book Jeff had us read, one which he said should serve as an inspiration for how we'd design AWS, was Creation: Life and How to Make It by Steve Grand. It's a book about programming artificial life, but the core principle that Jeff wanted us to take from it was the idea that complex things like life forms are built from very simple building blocks or primitives. It's the same thesis as that in Stephen Wolfram's A New Kind of Science.

The key implication for AWS from the book was about how to design the first AWS primitives. Jeff urged us to include only what was necessary and nothing more. If you were designing a storage service, like S3, you'd need functions like get, write, delete, but you wouldn't want to layer in things that weren't part of storage, like security. That should be a separate primitive.

The reason to design your primitives with the utmost elegance is to maximize combinatorial optionality.

who is in charge of developer experience? (at a developer focused platform company)
is it the PM or the dev advocate or the CEO or customer success or the tooling engineer?

does exception engineering play a role or is that everybody’s job?
understand when non-core things are bandaids
