- What is it?
	- software telemetry is what we all use to figure out what our software’s actually doing.
	- Software telemetry tells you what’s going on in the black box we’re building.
- 4 Major Styles
	- Centralized logging
		- **all text based** - rarely more than 30-60 days
		- ELK stack
		- all logs in central place, graphical UI, search, bisect/resect
	- Metrics
		- **numbers based** - more compact
		- counters and timers (how often, how long)
		- can store for 10 years
	- Traces
		- **GUI based**
		- use SDK to instrument code - open trace, do work, close trace
		- reassemble a stack trace for your distsys
	- SEIM - Security Event Information Management
- Concepts
	- Cardinality
	- Observability
		- Logs, Metrics, Traces working together
	- Push based monitoring vs pull based
		- "give me your status" on a schedule vs "i did a thing" whenever
		- network switches, infra monitoring, hardware mostly done by pull based - they dont have ability to push
			- use CollectD or Telegraph to do polling
			- Payload: small (<2kb), mostly JSON (serializes fast), some protobufs (controversial bc very static format, rigid schema... but integration with gRPC, versioning).
- OpenTelemetry
	- Transmission protocol for traces for the distributed tracing product. 
	- And they have this idea that they can extend it to do things like logging and metrics along the same protocol. 
- StatsD
	- 2010 - small Daemon UDP based that could take statistics information coming from software as a firehose and just send that into whatever your backend was.
- modern infrastructure
	- converged infra - single interface (grafana) gets you network port information, logs, execution rates for given functions in a DC or rack
- distributed tracing - 2015
	- high cardinality metrics to trace execution across 50-100 microservices 
- Jaeger
	- for tracing, also uses ES for datastore
	- can also use Cassandra for very large systems, but ES preferred for their indexing
- Crash reporting
	- the bare minimum you need eg if everything else is anonymized for privacy you still want this
	- different log stream than the others
	- iOS offers dedicated apis for this
- GDPR and Toxic Data
	- email address is PII
	- handle carefully
	- Amazon Macy can help, Azure also - built on ML models
	- Telemetry systems are business records and can be subpoenaed
