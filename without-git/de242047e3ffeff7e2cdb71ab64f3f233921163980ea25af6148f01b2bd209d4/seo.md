Link schemes
============

Any links intended to manipulate [PageRank](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank) or a site's ranking in Google search results may be considered part of a link scheme and a violation of Google's [Webmaster Guidelines](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/guidelines/webmaster-guidelines). This includes any behavior that manipulates links to your site or outgoing links from your site.

The following are examples of link schemes which can negatively impact a site's ranking in search results:

-   Buying or selling links that pass [PageRank](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank). This includes:
    -   Exchanging money for links, or posts that contain links
    -   Exchanging goods or services for links
    -   Sending someone a "free" product in exchange for them writing it and including a link
-   Excessive link exchanges ("Link to me and I'll link to you") or partner pages exclusively for the sake of cross-linking.
-   Large-scale article marketing or guest posting campaigns with keyword-rich anchor text links.
-   Using automated programs or services to create links to your site.
-   Requiring a link as part of a Terms of Service, contract, or similar arrangement without allowing a third-party content owner the choice [of qualifying the outbound link](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/guidelines/qualify-outbound-links), should they wish.

Additionally, creating links that weren't editorially placed or vouched for by the site's owner on a page, otherwise known as unnatural links, can be considered a violation of our guidelines. Here are a few common examples of unnatural links that may violate our guidelines:

-   Text advertisements that pass PageRank
-   Advertorials or native advertising where payment is received for articles that include links that pass PageRank
-   Links with optimized anchor text in articles or press releases distributed on other sites. For example:\
    *There are many [wedding rings](http://www.example.com/) on the market. If you want to have a [wedding](http://www.example.com/), you will have to pick the [best ring](http://www.example.com/). You will also need to [buy flowers](http://www.example.com/) and a [wedding dress](http://www.example.com/).*
-   Low-quality directory or bookmark site links
-   Keyword-rich, hidden or low-quality links embedded in widgets that are distributed across various sites, for example:\
    *Visitors to this page: 1,472\
    car insurance*
-   Widely distributed links in the footers or templates of various sites
-   Forum comments with optimized links in the post or signature, for example:\
    *Thanks, that's great info!\
    - Paul\
    [paul's pizza](http://www.example.com/) [san diego pizza](http://www.example.com/) [best pizza san diego](http://www.example.com/)*

As long as you don't pass PageRank to the buyer of the ad, your pay-per-click (PPC) advertising links won't violate our guidelines. You can prevent PageRank from passing in several ways, such as:

-   Indicating the link is sponsored adding a [qualifying attribute](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/advanced/guidelines/qualify-outbound-links) to the `<a>` tag
-   Redirecting the links to an intermediate page that is blocked from search engines with a robots.txt file

The best way to get other sites to create high-quality, relevant links to yours is to create unique, relevant content that can naturally gain popularity in the Internet community. Creating good content pays off: Links are usually editorial votes given by choice, and the more useful content you have, the greater the chances someone else will find that content valuable to their readers and link to it.
