Function which accepts a dictionary of key value pairs and returns a new flat list of only the keys.  Uses the .items() function with a for loop on the dictionary to track both the key and value and returns a new list by appending the keys to it. Best used on 1 level-deep key:value pair dictionaries (a flat dictionary) and not nested data-structures which are also commonly used with dictionaries. (a flat dictionary resembles a json and a flat list an array for javascript people).
