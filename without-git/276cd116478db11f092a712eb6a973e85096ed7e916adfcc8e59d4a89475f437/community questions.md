### community questions


What should I be observing? 
I have a personal philosophy of 'always be learning and observing'. I feel that the more we can do this, then the more answers naturally gravitate towards you.

What is it the community is doing and talking about?
What is important in your industry right now?
What are they excited about?
What annoys them?
What is their vision?
Why are they really there?
What’s stopping them from going somewhere else?
 
What conversations are happening?
The things people talk about are the clues you need. Pay attention to them. Be a good student and take notes!

What is (not) being talked about?
Is there a gap that can be served?
Who are the people that you can help?
Who are the people that can help you?
Do you have anything to add to the conversations?
Who aligns with your way of thinking?
How does your vision fit within these current conversations, if at all?
Taking the time to understand what people are talking about is your competitive advantage. The more time you take doing this, the more opportunities you will naturally discover that no one else will.
 

What is the vision of the organization?
Much of what community building is about is getting people to believe in the direction you are heading. They have to love, want, or need to be a part of it.

How can you get people excited about your vision?
Does your vision actually matter?
How will your vision be helping people?
What can you do to build trust?
Why should they follow your vision over someone else’s?
Does your vision overlap with the values they hold?
Does your vision stand a chance in the future?
Is your vision too big?
How can you break it down into smaller and meaningful actions?
 
What values do we hold?
The world is changing fast. The values and rituals that use to be formed from religion and culture no longer exist. We are multicultural and we need to redefine the values and rituals that matter to us today.

Who are you?
Who are you not?
Who do you want to be?
What new and exciting values can we co-create?
What new rituals can be formed?
How can we be less afraid of becoming the people we want to be?
What boundaries can we positively break?
This, to me, is perhaps one of the biggest areas of change and impact we can have as community builders. What we value is changing, constantly and increasingly quickly. How can we stay connected with all these moving pieces?
 

What trends are happening right now?
Personally, I mostly look at trends from a technological, business, or cultural perspective. You may have different focuses. 

Whatever trends you focus on, please don’t dismiss them. You only need to look back 1(!), 5, 10, 15 years ago to see how the world has dramatically changed.

There are so many questions you should be asking yourself, such as:

How are people changing their behaviors?
What are their spending habits like?
What tools are people (really) using?
Where are people naturally showing up?
Where and how is it hard to get people involved?
What behaviors are people naturally adopting?
Where are others succeeding, or failing?
How are people trying to gather?
How are people frustrated or tired?
