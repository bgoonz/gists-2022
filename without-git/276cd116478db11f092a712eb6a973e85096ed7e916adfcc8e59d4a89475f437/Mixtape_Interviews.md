## prelude script

The following is my conversation with Adam Argyle, CSS Developer Advocate for Google Chrome.

The conversation covers a quite a few topics that are relevant in the webdev and web design industries: UI complexity cliffs, DX vs UX, Self Disruption, and what Web Design Tooling could be.

Along the way we touch on what OpenUI is, Adam's Deferred Inputs proposal, the 4 Jobs of Developer Experience, Thoughtleading for Good from Emily Freeman, Ilya Grigorik, and Dion Almaier, and Adobe vs Figma vs Webflow.

I hope you enjoy these long form conversations I'm trying to produce with amazing developers. I haven't been as regular as I would like but I am investing into YouTube in 2022 and am keen on producing more high quality conversations. If you liked this, share it with a friend. If you have requests for other guests, tag them on social media. I'd like to basically make this a space where passionate builders and doers can talk about their craft and where things are going.
