- Story
	- started with tsdx - zero config - had issue with monorepo support
	- tried to extra lerna into a monorepo tool. 
	- implementing task running
	- researched how fb and google did it - a lot of their techniques hadnt made their way into the larger js ecosystem
	- take zero config and add as many of these advanced techniques as possible
	- make sure that it scales
- demo
	- npx create-turbo@latest turbo-demo
	- scaffolds a monorepo with apps (docs, web) and packages (design system, configs (eslint, tsconfig))
	- yarn turbo run build - builds both apps
	- second build is 100ms
	- fingerprints each build, and restores from cache, and replays the logs
	- never recompute work that has never been done before
	- 50-85% reduction in build/deployment times using turbo
	- execute multiple tasks at the same time: `yarn turbo run build test lint`
	- package.json - "turbo" pipeline - define topological relationships
- Graph
	- visualize graph `yarn turbo run build --graph`
- Profile build in chrome
	- `yarn turbo run build --force --profile`
- why monorepos
	- make cross cutting changes
	- search works
	- single source of truth for your project
	- react, jest, pnpm, yarn, nextjs
- Remote caching
	- available even if you dont use vercel
	- caches builds by coworkers
	- Make was made in 1979 and only remembers the last build
	- "dropbox for dist directories"
	- what if different artefacts across operating systems? -> hashes are different
- difference vs nx
	- wanted something more lighter weight
	- ease of incremental migration - moving from lerna, yarn/pnpm workspaces
	- less invasive
	- didnt require bunch of plugins - battery pack included
- misc
	- if you take nothing away from this, use pnpm, shave minutes off build times
- Roadmap
	- telemetry
	- sharding parallel tasks in other processes
	- presets - turbo season 2
		- "our goal is to kill config"
		- turbo season 1 - get task running done first
	- more intelligent watch mode
	- public/private caches. security model is like npm
