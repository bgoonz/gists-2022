                            <p>Alan Bean was one of the third group of astronauts named by NASA in October 1963. He
                                served as backup astronaut for the Gemini 10 and Apollo 9 missions. Captain Bean was
                                lunar module pilot on Apollo 12, mans second lunar landing.
                                In November 1969, Captain Bean and Captain Pete Conrad landed in the moons Ocean of
                                Stormsafter a flight of some 250,000 miles. They explored the lunar surface, deployed
                                several lunar surface experiments, and installed the
                                first nuclear power generator station on the moon to provide the power source. Captain
                                Richard Gordon remained in lunar orbit photographing landing sites for future missions.
                                Captain Bean was spacecraft commander of Skylab
                                Mission II (SL-3), July 29 to September 25, 1973. With him on the 59-day, 24,400,000
                                mile world record setting flight were scientist-astronaut Dr. Owen K. Garriott and
                                Marine Corps Lieutenant Colonel Jack R. Lousma. Mission
                                II accomplished 150% of its pre-mission forecast goals. On his next assignment, Captain
                                Bean was backup spacecraft commander of the United States flight crew for the joint
                                American-Russian Apollo-Soyuz Test Project. Captain
                                Bean has logged 1,671 hours and 45 minutes in spaceof which 10 hours and 26 minutes were
                                spent in EVAs on the moon and in earth orbit.

                            <p>Rear Admiral Shepard was one of the Mercury astronauts named by NASA in April 1959, and
                                he holds the distinction of being the first American to journey into space. On May 5,
                                1961, in the Freedom 7 spacecraft, he was launched by
                                a Redstone vehicle on a ballistic trajectory suborbital flight--a flight which carried
                                him to an altitude of 116 statute miles and to a landing point 302 statute miles down
                                the Atlantic Missile Range. In 1963, he was designated
                                Chief of the Astronaut Office with responsibility for monitoring the coordination,
                                scheduling, and control of all activities involving NASA astronauts. This included
                                monitoring the development and implementation of effective
                                training programs to assure the flight readiness of available pilot/non-pilot personnel
                                for assignment to crew positions on manned space flights; furnishing pilot evaluations
                                applicable to the design, construction, and operations
                                of spacecraft systems and related equipment; and providing qualitative scientific and
                                engineering observations to facilitate overall mission planning, formulation of feasible
                                operational procedures, and selection and conduct
                                of specific experiments for each flight. He was restored to full flight status in May
                                1969, following corrective surgery for an inner ear disorder. Shepard made his second
                                space flight as spacecraft commander on Apollo 14,
                                January 31 - February 9, 1971. He was accompanied on man's third lunar landing mission
                                by Stuart A. Roosa, command module pilot, and Edgar D. Mitchell, lunar module pilot.
                                Maneuvering their lunar module, "Antares," to a landing
                                in the hilly upland Fra Mauro region of the moon, Shepard and Mitchell subsequently
                                deployed and activated various scientific equipment and experiments and collected almost
                                100 pounds of lunar samples for return to earth. Other
                                Apollo 14 achievements included: first use of Mobile Equipment Transporter (MET);
                                largest payload placed in lunar orbit; longest distance traversed on the lunar surface;
                                largest payload returned from the lunar surface; longest
                                lunar surface stay time (33 hours); longest lunar surface EVA (9 hours and 17 minutes);
                                first use of shortened lunar orbit rendezvous techniques; first use of colored TV with
                                new vidicon tube on lunar surface; and first extensive
                                orbital science period conducted during CSM solo operations.

                            <p>Aldrin was one of the third group of astronauts named by NASA in October 1963. On
                                November 11, 1966, he and command pilot James Lovell were launched into space in the
                                Gemini 12 spacecraft on a 4-day flight, which brought the Gemini
                                program to a successful close. Aldrin established a new record for extravehicular
                                activity (EVA), spending 5-1/2 hours outside the spacecraft. He served as lunar module
                                pilot for Apollo 11, July 16-24, 1969, the first manned
                                lunar landing mission. Aldrin followed Neil Armstrong onto the lunar surface on July 20,
                                1969, completing a 2-hour and 15 minute lunar EVA. In July 1971, Aldrin resigned from
                                NASA. Aldrin has logged 289 hours and 53 minutes
                                in space, of which, 7 hours and 52 minutes were spent in EVA.

                            <p>Duke was one of the 19 astronauts selected by NASA in April 1966. He served as member of
                                the astronaut support crew for the Apollo 10 flight. He was CAPCOM for Apollo 11, the
                                first landing on the Moon and he served as backup lunar
                                module pilot on Apollo 13. Duke served as lunar module pilot of Apollo 16, April 16-27,
                                1972. He was accompanied on the fifth manned lunar landing mission by John W. Young
                                (spacecraft commander) and Thomas K. Mattingly II (command
                                module pilot). Apollo 16 was the first scientific expedition to inspect, survey, and
                                sample materials and surface features in the Descartes region of the rugged lunar
                                highlands. Duke and Young commenced their record setting
                                lunar surface stay of 71 hours and 14 minutes by maneuvering the lunar module "Orion" to
                                a landing on the rough Cayley Plains. In three subsequent excursions onto the lunar
                                surface, they each logged 20 hours and 15 minutes
                                in extravehicular activities involving the emplacement and activation of scientific
                                equipment and experiments, the collection of nearly 213 pounds of rock and soil samples,
                                and the evaluation and use of Rover-2 over the roughest
                                and blockiest surface yet encountered on the moon. Other Apollo 16 achievements included
                                the largest payload placed in lunar orbit (76, 109 pounds); first cosmic ray detector
                                deployed on lunar surface; first lunar observatory
                                with the far UV camera; and longest in-flight EVA from a command module during
                                transearth coast (1 hour and 13 minutes). The latter feat was accomplished by Mattingly
                                when he ventured out to "Casper's" SIM-bay for the retrieval
                                of vital film cassettes from the panoramic and mapping cameras. Apollo 16 concluded with
                                a Pacific Ocean splashdown and subsequent recovery by the USS TICONDEROGA. With the
                                completion of his first space flight, Duke has logged
                                265 hours in space and over 21 hours of extra vehicular activity. Duke also served as
                                backup lunar module pilot for Apollo 17.

                            <p>Scott was one of the third group of astronauts named by NASA in October 1963. On March
                                16, 1966, he and command pilot Neil Armstrong were launched into space on the Gemini 8
                                mission--a flight originally scheduled to last three
                                days but terminated early due to a malfunctioning thruster. The crew performed the first
                                successful docking of two vehicles in space and demonstrated great piloting skill in
                                overcoming the thruster problem and bringing the
                                spacecraft to a safe landing. Scott served as command module pilot for Apollo 9, March
                                3-13, 1969. This was the third manned flight in the Apollo series, the second to be
                                launched by a Saturn V, and the first to complete a
                                comprehensive earth-orbital qualification and verification test of a "fully configured
                                Apollo spacecraft." The ten-day flight provided vital information previously not
                                available on the operational performance, stability, and
                                reliability of lunar module propulsion and life support systems. Highlight of this
                                evaluation was completion of a critical lunar-orbit rendezvous simulation and subsequent
                                docking, initiated by James McDivitt and Russell Schweickart
                                from within the lunar module at a separation distance which exceeded 100 miles from the
                                command/service module piloted by Scott. The crew also demonstrated and confirmed the
                                operational feasibility of crew transfer and extravehicular
                                activity techniques and equipment, with Schweickart completing a 46-minute EVA outside
                                the lunar module. During this period, Dave Scott completed a 1-hour stand-up EVA in the
                                open command module hatch photographing Schweickart's
                                activities and also retrieving thermal samples from the command module exterior. Apollo
                                9 splashed down less than four miles from the helicopter carrier USS GUADALCANAL. In his
                                next assignment, Scott was designated backup spacecraft
                                commander for Apollo 12. He made his third space flight as spacecraft commander of
                                Apollo 15, July 26 - August 7, 1971. His companions on the flight were Alfred M. Worden
                                (command module pilot) and James B. Irwin (lunar module
                                pilot). Apollo 15 was the fourth manned lunar landing mission and the first to visit and
                                explore the moon's Hadley Rille and Apennine Mountains which are located on the
                                southeast edge of the Mare Imbrium (Sea of Rains). The
                                lunar module, "Falcon," remained on the lunar surface for 66 hours and 54 minutes
                                (setting a new record for lunar surface stay time) and Scott and Irwin logged 18 hours
                                and 35 minutes each in extravehicular activities conducted
                                during three separate excursions onto the lunar surface. Using "Rover-1" to transport
                                themselves and their equipment along portions of Hadley Rille and the Apennine
                                Mountains, Scott and Irwin performed a selenological inspection
                                and survey of the area and collected 180 pounds of lunar surface materials. They
                                deployed an ALSEP package which involved the emplacement and activation of surface
                                experiments, and their lunar surface activities were televised
                                using a TV camera which was operated remotely by ground controllers stationed in the
                                mission control center located at Houston, Texas. Other Apollo 15 achievements include:
                                largest payloads ever placed into earth and lunar
                                orbits; first scientific instrument module bay flown and operated on an Apollo
                                spacecraft; longest distance traversed on lunar surface; first use of a lunar surface
                                navigation device (mounted on Rover-1); first subsatellite
                                launched in lunar orbit; and first extravehicular (EVA) from a command module during
                                transearth coast. The latter feat performed by Worden during three excursions to
                                "Endeavour's" SIM-bay where he retrieved film cassettes from
                                the panoramic and mapping cameras and reported his personal observations of the general
                                condition of equipment housed there. Apollo 15 concluded with a Pacific Ocean splashdown
                                and subsequent recovery by the USS OKINAWA.

                            <p>Mitchell was a member of Group 5, selected for astronaut training in April 1966. He
                                served as a member of the astronaut support crew for Apollo 9 and as backup lunar module
                                pilot for Apollo 10. On January 31, 1971, serving as lunar
                                module pilot, Dr. Edgar Mitchell, then a U.S. Navy Captain, embarked on a journey
                                through outer space of some 500,000 miles that resulted in becoming the sixth man to
                                walk on the moon. That historic journey terminated safely
                                nine days later on February 9, 1971 and was made in the company of two other men of
                                valor Admiral Alan Shepard and Colonel Stuart Roosa. Maneuvering their lunar module,
                                Antares, to a landing in the hilly upland Fra Mauro region
                                of the moon, Shepard and Mitchell subsequently deployed and activated various scientific
                                equipment and experiments and collected almost 100 pounds of lunar samples for return to
                                Earth. Other Apollo 14 achievements included:
                                first use of Mobile Equipment Transporter (MET); largest payload placed in lunar orbit;
                                longest distance traversed on the lunar surface; largest payload returned from the lunar
                                surface; longest lunar surface stay time (33 hours);
                                longest lunar surface EVA (9 hours and 17 minutes); first use of shortened lunar orbit
                                rendezvous techniques; first use of color TV with new vidicon tube on lunar surface; and
                                first extensive orbital science period conducted
                                during CSM solo operations. In completing his first space flight, Mitchell logged a
                                total of 216 hours and 42 minutes in space. He was subsequently designated to serve as
                                backup lunar module pilot for Apollo 16.

                            <p>Captain Cernan was one of fourteen astronauts selected by NASA in October 1963. He
                                occupied the pilot seat alongside of command pilot Tom Stafford on the Gemini IX
                                mission. During this 3-day flight which Began on June 3, 1966,
                                the spacecraft achieved a circular orbit of 161 statute miles; the crew used three
                                different techniques to effect rendezvous with the previously launched Augmented Target
                                Docking Adapter; and Cernan, the second American to
                                walk in space, logged two hours and ten minutes outside the spacecraft in extravehicular
                                activities. The flight ended after 72 hours and 20 minutes with a perfect re-entry and
                                recovery as Gemini IX landed within 1-1/2 miles
                                of the prime recovery ship USS WASP and 3/8 of a mile from the predetermined target.
                                Cernan subsequently served as backup pilot for Gemini 12 and as backup lunar module
                                pilot for Apollo 7. On his second space flight, he was
                                lunar module pilot of Apollo 10, May 18-26, 1969, the first comprehensive lunar-orbital
                                qualification and verification flight test of an Apollo lunar module. He was accompanied
                                on the 248,000 nautical sojourn to the moon by
                                Thomas P. Stafford (spacecraft commander) and John W. Young (commander module pilot). In
                                accomplishing all of the assigned objectives of this mission, Apollo 10 confirmed the
                                operations performance, stability, and reliability
                                of the command/service module and lunar module configuration during trans-lunar coast,
                                lunar orbit insertion, and lunar module separation and descent to within 8 nautical
                                miles of the lunar surface. The latter maneuver involved
                                employing all but the final minutes of the technique prescribed for use in an actual
                                lunar landing, and allowed critical evaluations of the lunar module propulsions systems
                                and rendezvous of the landing radar devices in subsequent
                                rendezvous and re-docking maneuvers. In addition to demonstrating that man could
                                navigate safely and accurately in the moon's gravitational fields, Apollo 10
                                photographed and mapped tentative landing sites for future missions.
                                Cernan's next assignment was backup spacecraft commander for Apollo 14. He made his
                                third space flight as spacecraft commander of Apollo 17--the last scheduled manned
                                mission to the moon for the United States--which commenced
                                at 11:33 P.M. (CST), December 6, 1972, with the first manned nighttime launch, and
                                concluded on December 19, 1972. With him on the voyage of the command module "America"
                                and the lunar module "Challenger" were Ronald Evans (command
                                module pilot) and Harrison H. (Jack) Schmitt (lunar module pilot). In maneuvering
                                "Challenger" to a landing at Taurus-Littrow, located on the southeast edge of Mare
                                Serenitatis, Cernan and Schmitt activated a base of operations
                                from which they completed three highly successful excursions to the nearby craters and
                                the Taurus mountains, making the Moon their home for over three days. This last mission
                                to the moon established several new records for
                                manned space flight that include: longest manned lunar landing flight (301 hours 51
                                minutes); longest lunar surface extravehicular activities (22 hours 6 minutes); largest
                                lunar sample return (an estimated 115 kg (249 lbs.);
                                and longest time in lunar orbit (147 hours 48 minutes). While Cernan and Schmitt
                                conducted activities on the lunar surface, Evans remained in lunar orbit aboard the
                                "America" completing assigned work tasks requiring geological
                                observations, handheld photography of specific targets, and the control of cameras and
                                other highly sophisticated scientific equipment carried in the command module SIM-bay.
                                Evans also completed a 1-hour, 6-minute extravehicular
                                activity on the transearth coast phase of the return flight, successfully retrieving
                                three camera cassettes and completing a personal inspection of the equipment bay area.
                                Apollo 17 ended with a splashdown in the Pacific Ocean
                                approximately 0.4 miles from the target point and 4.3 miles form the prime recovery ship
                                USS TICONDEROGA. Captain Cernan was the second American to have walked in space having
                                spanned the circumference of the world twice in
                                a little more than 2-1/2 hours. He was one of the two men to have flown to the moon on
                                two occasions, and as commander of the last mission to the moon, Apollo 17, had the
                                privilege and distinction of being the last man to have
                                left his footprints on the surface of the moon.

                                instrumental in providing Apollo flight crews with detailed instruction in lunar
                                navigation, geology, and feature recognition. Schmitt also assisted in the integration
                                of scientific activities into the Apollo lunar missions
                                and participated in research activities requiring geologic, petrographic, and
                                stratigraphic analyses of samples returned from the moon by Apollo missions. On his
                                first journey into space, Dr. Schmitt occupied the lunar module
                                pilot seat for Apollo 17 -- the last scheduled manned Apollo mission to the United
                                States --which commenced at 11:33 p.m. (CST), December 6, 1972, and concluded on
                                December 19, 1972. He was accompanied on the voyage of the

                                commander) and Ronald Evans (command module pilot). In maneuvering "Challenger" to a
                                landing at Taurus-Littrow, which is located on the
                                southeast edge of Mare Serenitatis, Schmitt and Cernan activated a base of operations
                                facilitating their completion of three days of exploration. This last Apollo mission to
                                the moon for the United States broke several records
                                set by previous flights and include: longest manned lunar landing flight (301 hours, 51

                            <p>Colonel Irwin was one of the 19 astronauts selected by NASA in April 1966. He was crew
                                commander of lunar module (LTA-8)-this vehicle finished the first series of thermal
                                vacuum tests on June 1, 1968. He also served as a member
                                of the astronaut support crew for Apollo 10 and as backup lunar module pilot for the
                                Apollo 12 flight. Irwin served as lunar module pilot for Apollo, July 26 to August 7,
                                1971. His companions on the flight were David R. Scott,
                                spacecraft commander and Alfred M. Worden, command module pilot. Apollo 15 was the
                                fourth manned lunar landing mission and the first to visit and explore the moon's Hadley
                                Rille and Apennine Mountains which are located on the
                                southeast edge of the Mare Imbrium (Sea of Rains). The lunar module, "Falcon", remained
                                on the lunar surface for 66 hours, 54 minutes-setting a new record for lunar surface
                                stay time-and Scott and Irwin logged 18 hours and
                                35 minutes each in extravehicular activities conducted during three separate excursions
                                onto the lunar surface. Using "Rover-l" to transport themselves and their equipment
                                along portions of Hadley Rille and the Apinnine Mountains,
                                Scott and Irwin performed a selenological inspection and survey of the area and
                                collected approximately 180 pounds of lunar surface materials. They deployed an ALSEP
                                package which involved the emplacement and activation of
                                surface experiments, and their lunar surface activities were televised in color using a

                                scientific instrument module bay flown and operated on an Apollo spacecraft; longest
                                distance traversed on lunar surface; first use of
                                a lunar surface navigation device, mounted on Rover 1; first subsatellite launched in
                                lunar orbit; and first extravehicular activity (EVA) from a command module during
                                transearth coast. The latter feat was accomplished by Worden
                                during three excursions to "Endeavour's" SIM bay where he retrieved film cassettes from
                                the panoramic and mapping cameras and reported his personal observations of the general
                                condition of equipment housed there. Apollo 15
                                concluded with a Pacific splashdown and subsequent recovery by the USS OKINAWA.

                            <p>In September 1962, Young was selected as an astronaut. He is the first person to fly in
                                space six times from earth, and seven times counting his lunar liftoff. The first flight
                                was with Gus Grissom in Gemini 3, the first manned
                                Gemini mission, on March 23, 1965. This was a complete end-to-end test of the Gemini
                                spacecraft, during which Gus accomplished the first manual change of orbit altitude and
                                plane and the first lifting reentry, and Young operated
                                the first computer on a manned spacecraft. On Gemini 10, July 18-21, 1966, Young, as
                                Commander, and Mike Collins, as Pilot, completed a dual rendezvous with two separate
                                Agena target vehicles. While Young flew close formation
                                on the second Agena, Mike Collins did an extravehicular transfer to retrieve a micro
                                meteorite detector from that Agena. On his third flight, May 18-26, 1969, Young was
                                Command Module Pilot of Apollo 10. Tom Stafford and Gene
                                Cernan were also on this mission which orbited the Moon, completed a lunar rendezvous,
                                and tracked proposed lunar landing sites. His fourth space flight, Apollo 16, April
                                16-27, 1972, was a lunar exploration mission, with Young
                                as Spacecraft Commander, and Ken Mattingly and Charlie Duke. Young and Duke set up
                                scientific equipment and explored the lunar highlands at Descartes. They collected 200
                                pounds of rocks and drove over 16 miles in the lunar
                                rover on three separate geology traverses. Young’s fifth flight was as Spacecraft
                                Commander of STS-1, the first flight of the Space Shuttle, April 12-14, 1981, with Bob
                                Crippen as Pilot. The 54-1/2 hour, 36-orbit mission verified
                                Space Shuttle systems performance during launch, on orbit, and entry. Tests of the
                                Orbiter Columbia included evaluation of mechanical systems including the payload bay
                                doors, the attitude and maneuvering rocket thrusters, guidance
                                and navigation systems, and Orbiter/crew compatibility. One hundred and thirty three of
                                the mission’s flight test objectives were accomplished. The Orbiter Columbia was the
                                first manned spaceship tested during ascent, on orbit,
                                and entry without benefit of previous unmanned missions. Columbia was also the first
                                winged reentry vehicle to return from space to a runway landing. It weighed about 98
                                tons as Young landed it on the dry lakebed at Edwards
                                Air Force Base, California. Young’s sixth flight was as Spacecraft Commander of STS-9,
                                the first Spacelab mission, November 28-December 8, 1983, with Pilot Brewster Shaw,
                                Mission Specialists Bob Parker and Owen Garriott, and
                                Payload Specialists Byron Lichtenberg of the USA and Ulf Merbold of West Germany. The
                                mission successfully completed all 94 of its flight test objectives. For ten days the
                                6-man crew worked 12-hour shifts around-the-clock,
                                performing more than 70 experiments in the fields of atmospheric physics, Earth
                                observations, space plasma physics, astronomy and solar physics, materials processing
                                and life sciences. The mission returned more scientific and
                                technical data than all the previous Apollo and Skylab missions put together. The
                                Spacelab was brought back for re-use, so that Columbia weighed over 110 tons as Young
                                landed the spaceship at Edwards Air Force Base, California.

                            <p>As a research pilot at NASA’s Flight Research Center, Edwards, California, Armstrong was
                                a project pilot on many pioneering high speed aircraft, including the well known,
                                4000-mph X-15. He flew more than 200 different models of
                                aircraft, including jets, rockets, helicopters and gliders. Armstrong transferred to
                                astronaut status in 1962. He was assigned as command pilot for the Gemini 8 mission.
                                Gemini 8 was launched on March 16, 1966, and Armstrong
                                performed the first successful docking of two vehicles in space. As spacecraft commander
                                for Apollo 11, the first manned lunar landing mission, Armstrong gained the distinction
                                of being the first man to land a craft on the
                                moon and first to step on its surface. Armstrong subsequently held the position of
                                Deputy Associate Administrator for Aeronautics, NASA Headquarters, Washington, D.C. In
                                this position, he was responsible for the coordination
                                and management of overall NASA research and technology work related to aeronautics.

                            <p>In September of 1962, Mr. Conrad was selected as an astronaut by NASA. His first flight
                                was Gemini V, which established the space endurance record and placed the United States
                                in the lead for man-hours in space. As commander of
                                Gemini XI, Mr. Conrad helped to set a world's altitude record. He then served as
                                commander of Apollo XII, the second lunar landing. On Mr. Conrad's final mission, he
                                served as commander of Skylab II, the first United States
                                Space Station. In December 1973, after serving 20 years (11 of which were as an
                                astronaut in the space program), Mr. Conrad retired from the U.S. Navy to accept a
                                position as Vice President - Operations and Chief Operating
                                Office of American Television and Communications Corporation (ATC). At ATC, he was
                                responsible for both the operation of existing systems and the national development of
                                new cable television systems. In 1976, he resigned from
                                ATC to accept the position of Vice President and consultant to McDonnell Douglas
                                Corporation. In 1978, he became Vice President of marketing and was responsible for all
                                commercial and military sales for Douglas Aircraft Company.
                                Mr. Conrad then became Senior Vice President-Marketing in 1980. He was appointed as
                                Senior Vice President Marketing and Product Support in 1982 and 1984, was named Staff
                                Vice President of International Business Development
                                for McDonnell Douglas Corporation.
