# Sharing State Between Components

> ## Excerpt
> A JavaScript library for building user interfaces

---
Sometimes, you want the state of two components to always change together. To do it, remove state from both of them, move it to their closest common parent, and then pass it down to them via props. This is known as “lifting state up”, and it’s one of the most common things you will do writing React code.

### You will learn

-   How to share state between components by lifting it up
-   What are controlled and uncontrolled components

## Lifting state up by example

In this example, a parent `Accordion` component renders two separate `Panel`s:

-   `Accordion`
    -   `Panel`
    -   `Panel`

Each `Panel` component has a boolean `isActive` state that determines whether its content is visible.

Press the Show button for both panels:

import { useState } from 'react';

function Panel({ title, children }) {
  const \[isActive, setIsActive\] = useState(false);
  return (
    <section className="panel">
      <h3>{title}</h3>
      {isActive ? (
        <p>{children}</p>
      ) : (
        <button onClick={() => setIsActive(true)}>
          Show
        </button>
      )}
    </section>
  );
}

export default function Accordion() {
  return (
    <>
      <h2>Almaty, Kazakhstan</h2>
      <Panel title="About">
        With a population of about 2 million, Almaty is Kazakhstan's largest city. From 1929 to 1997, it was its capital city.
      </Panel>
      <Panel title="Etymology">
        The name comes from <span lang="kk-KZ">алма</span>, the Kazakh word for "apple" and is often translated as "full of apples". In fact, the region surrounding Almaty is thought to be the ancestral home of the apple, and the wild <i lang="la">Malus sieversii</i> is considered a likely candidate for the ancestor of the modern domestic apple.
      </Panel>
    </>
  );
}

Notice how pressing one panel’s button does not affect the other panel—they are independent.

**But now let’s say you want to change it so that only one panel is expanded at any given time.** With that design, expanding the second panel should collapse the first one. How would you do that?

To coordinate these two panels, you need to “lift their state up” to a parent component in three steps:

1.  **Remove** state from the child components.
2.  **Pass** hardcoded data from the common parent.
3.  **Add** state to the common parent and pass it down together with the event handlers.

This will allow the `Accordion` component to coordinate both `Panel`s and only expand one at a time.

![On the left are two components each owning their own state values. On the right, they are the children of a parent component that owns both their state values.](https://beta.reactjs.org/images/docs/sketches/s_lifting-state-up.png)

### Step 1: Remove state from the child components

You will give control of the `Panel`’s `isActive` to its parent component. This means that the parent component will pass `isActive` to `Panel` as a prop instead. Start by **removing this line** from the `Panel` component:

```
const [isActive, setIsActive] = useState(false);
```

And instead, add `isActive` to the `Panel`’s list of props:

```
function Panel({ title, children, isActive }) {
```

Now the `Panel`’s parent component can _control_ `isActive` by [passing it down as a prop](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/passing-props-to-a-component). Conversely, the `Panel` component now has _no control_ over the value of `isActive`—it’s now up to the parent component!

### Step 2: Pass hardcoded data from the common parent

To lift state up, you must locate the closest common parent component of _both_ of the child components that you want to coordinate:

-   `Accordion` _(closest common parent)_
    -   `Panel`
    -   `Panel`

In this example, it’s the `Accordion` component. Since it’s above both panels and can control their props, it will become the “source of truth” for which panel is currently active. Make the `Accordion` component pass a hardcoded value of `isActive` (for example, `true`) to both panels:

import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Accordion() {
  return (
    <>
      <h2>Almaty, Kazakhstan</h2>
      <Panel title="About" isActive={true}>
        With a population of about 2 million, Almaty is Kazakhstan's largest city. From 1929 to 1997, it was its capital city.
      </Panel>
      <Panel title="Etymology" isActive={true}>
        The name comes from <span lang="kk-KZ">алма</span>, the Kazakh word for "apple" and is often translated as "full of apples". In fact, the region surrounding Almaty is thought to be the ancestral home of the apple, and the wild <i lang="la">Malus sieversii</i> is considered a likely candidate for the ancestor of the modern domestic apple.
      </Panel>
    </>
  );
}

function Panel({ title, children, isActive }) {
  return (
    <section className="panel">
      <h3>{title}</h3>
      {isActive ? (
        <p>{children}</p>
      ) : (
        <button onClick={() => setIsActive(true)}>
          Show
        </button>
      )}
    </section>
  );
}

Try editing the hardcoded `isActive` values in the `Accordion` component and see the result on the screen.

### Step 3: Add state to the common parent

Lifting state up often changes the nature of what you’re storing as state.

![The parent component passes the state setting function to both child components.](https://beta.reactjs.org/images/docs/sketches/s_passing-functions-down.png)

In this case, only one panel should be active at a time. This means that the `Accordion` common parent component needs to keep track of _which_ panel is the active one. Instead of a `boolean` value, it could use an number as the index of the active `Panel` for the state variable:

```
const [activeIndex, setActiveIndex] = useState(0);
```

When the `activeIndex` is `0`, the first panel is active, and when it’s `1`, it’s the second one.

Clicking the “Show” button in either `Panel` needs to change the active index in `Accordion`. A `Panel` can’t set the `activeIndex` state directly because it’s defined inside the `Accordion`. The `Accordion` component needs to _explicitly allow_ the `Panel` component to change its state by [passing an event handler down as a prop](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/responding-to-events#passing-event-handlers-as-props):

```
<>
  <Panel
    isActive={activeIndex === 0}
    onShow={() => setActiveIndex(0)}
  >
    ...
  </Panel>
  <Panel
    isActive={activeIndex === 1}
    onShow={() => setActiveIndex(1)}
  >
    ...
  </Panel>
</>
```

The `<button>` inside the `Panel` will now use the `onShow` prop as its click event handler:

import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Accordion() {
  const \[activeIndex, setActiveIndex\] = useState(0);
  return (
    <>
      <h2>Almaty, Kazakhstan</h2>
      <Panel
        title="About"
        isActive={activeIndex === 0}
        onShow={() => setActiveIndex(0)}
      >
        With a population of about 2 million, Almaty is Kazakhstan's largest city. From 1929 to 1997, it was its capital city.
      </Panel>
      <Panel
        title="Etymology"
        isActive={activeIndex === 1}
        onShow={() => setActiveIndex(1)}
      >
        The name comes from <span lang="kk-KZ">алма</span>, the Kazakh word for "apple" and is often translated as "full of apples". In fact, the region surrounding Almaty is thought to be the ancestral home of the apple, and the wild <i lang="la">Malus sieversii</i> is considered a likely candidate for the ancestor of the modern domestic apple.
      </Panel>
    </>
  );
}

function Panel({
  title,
  children,
  isActive,
  onShow
}) {
  return (
    <section className="panel">
      <h3>{title}</h3>
      {isActive ? (
        <p>{children}</p>
      ) : (
        <button onClick={onShow}>
          Show
        </button>
      )}
    </section>
  );
}

This completes lifting state up! Moving state into the common parent component allowed you to coordinate the two panels. Using the active index instead of two “is shown” flags ensured that only one panel is active at a given time. And passing down the event handler to the child allowed the child to change the parent’s state.

##### Deep Dive

### Controlled and Uncontrolled Components

## A single source of truth for each state

In a React application, many components will have their own state. Some state may “live” close to the leaf components (components at the bottom of the tree) like inputs. Other state may “live” closer to the top of the app. For example, even client-side routing libraries are usually implemented by storing the current route in the React state, and passing it down by props!

**For each unique piece of state, you will choose the component that “owns” it**. This principle is also known as having a [“single source of truth.”](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_source_of_truth) It doesn’t mean that all state lives in one place—but that for _each_ piece of state, there is a _specific_ component that holds that piece of information. Instead of duplicating shared state between components, you will _lift it up_ to their common shared parent, and _pass it down_ to the children that need it.

Your app will change as you work on it. It is common that you will move state down or back up while you’re still figuring out where each piece of the state “lives”. This is all part of the process!

To see what this feels like in practice with a few more components, read [Thinking in React](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/thinking-in-react).

## Recap

-   When you want to coordinate two components, move their state to their common parent.
-   Then pass the information down through props from their common parent.
-   Finally, pass the event handlers down so that the children can change the parent’s state.
-   It’s useful to consider components as “controlled” (driven by props) or “uncontrolled” (driven by state).

### Synced inputs

These two inputs are independent. Make them stay in sync: editing one input should update the other input with the same text, and vice versa.

import { useState } from 'react';

export default function SyncedInputs() {
  return (
    <>
      <Input label="First input" />
      <Input label="Second input" />
    </>
  );
}

function Input({ label }) {
  const \[text, setText\] = useState('');

  function handleChange(e) {
    setText(e.target.value);
  }

  return (
    <label>
      {label}
      {' '}
      <input
        value={text}
        onChange={handleChange}
      />
    </label>
  );
}
