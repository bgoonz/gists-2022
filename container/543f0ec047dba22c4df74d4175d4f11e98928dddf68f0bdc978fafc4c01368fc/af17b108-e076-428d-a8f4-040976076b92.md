# Your First Component

> ## Excerpt

> A JavaScript library for building user interfaces

Components are one of the core concepts of React. They are the foundation upon which you build user interfaces (UI), which makes them the perfect place to start your React journey!

### You will learn

- What a component is
- What role components play in a React application
- How to write your first React component

## Components: UI building blocks

On the Web, HTML lets us create rich structured documents with its built-in set of tags like `<h1>` and `<li>`:

```
<article>
  <h1>My First Component</h1>
  <ol>
    <li>Components: UI Building Blocks</li>
    <li>Defining a Component</li>
    <li>Using a Component</li>
  </ol>
</article>
```

This markup represents this article `<article>`, its heading `<h1>`, and an (abbreviated) table of contents as an ordered list `<ol>`. Markup like this, combined with CSS for style, and JavaScript for interactivity, lies behind every sidebar, avatar, modal, dropdown—every piece of UI you see on the Web.

React lets you combine your markup, CSS, and JavaScript into custom “components,” **reusable UI elements for your app.** The table of contents code you saw above could be turned into a `<TableOfContents />` component you could render on every page. Under the hood, it still uses the same HTML tags like `<article>`, `<h1>`, etc.

Just like with HTML tags, you can compose, order and nest components to design whole pages. For example, the documentation page you’re reading is made out of React components:

```
<PageLayout>
  <NavigationHeader>
    <SearchBar />
    <Link to="/docs">Docs</Link>
  </NavigationHeader>
  <Sidebar />
  <PageContent>
    <TableOfContents />
    <DocumentationText />
  </PageContent>
</PageLayout>
```

As your project grows, you will notice that many of your designs can be composed by reusing components you already wrote, speeding up your development. Our table of contents above could be added to any screen with `<TableOfContents />`! You can even jumpstart your project with the thousands of components shared by the React open source community like [Chakra UI](https://chakra-ui.com/) and [Material UI](https://material-ui.com/).

## Defining a component

Traditionally when creating web pages, web developers marked up their content and then added interaction by sprinkling on some JavaScript. This worked great when interaction was a nice-to-have on the web. Now it is expected for many sites and all apps. React puts interactivity first while still using the same technology: **a React component is a JavaScript function that you can _sprinkle with markup_**. Here’s what that looks like (you can edit the example below):

export default function Profile() {
return (
<img
      src="https://i.imgur.com/MK3eW3Am.jpg"
      alt="Katherine Johnson"
    />
)
}

And here’s how to build a component:

### Step 1: Export the component

The `export default` prefix is a [standard JavaScript syntax](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/web/javascript/reference/statements/export) (not specific to React). It lets you mark the main function in a file so that you can later import it from other files. (More on importing in [Importing and Exporting Components](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/importing-and-exporting-components)!)

### Step 2: Define the function

With `function Profile() { }` you define a JavaScript function with the name `Profile`.

### Pitfall

React components are regular JavaScript functions, but **their names must start with a capital letter** or they won’t work!

### Step 3: Add markup

The component returns an `<img />` tag with `src` and `alt` attributes. `<img />` is written like HTML, but it is actually JavaScript under the hood! This syntax is called [JSX](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/writing-markup-with-jsx), and it lets you embed markup inside JavaScript.

Return statements can be written all on one line, as in this component:

```
return <img src="https://i.imgur.com/MK3eW3As.jpg" alt="Katherine Johnson" />;
```

But if your markup isn’t all on the same line as the `return` keyword, you must wrap it in a pair of parentheses like this:

```
return (
  <div>
    <img src="https://i.imgur.com/MK3eW3As.jpg" alt="Katherine Johnson" />
  </div>
);
```

## Using a component

Now that you’ve defined your `Profile` component, you can nest it inside other components. For example, you can export a `Gallery` component that uses multiple `Profile` components:

function Profile() {
return (
<img
      src="https://i.imgur.com/MK3eW3As.jpg"
      alt="Katherine Johnson"
    />
);
}

export default function Gallery() {
return (
<section>
<h1>Amazing scientists</h1>
<Profile />
<Profile />
<Profile />
</section>
);
}

### What the browser sees

Notice the difference in casing:

- `<section>` is lowercase, so React knows we refer to an HTML tag.
- `<Profile />` starts with a capital `P`, so React knows that we want to use our component called `Profile`.

And `Profile` contains even more HTML: `<img />`. In the end, this is what the browser sees:

```
<section>
  <h1>Amazing scientists</h1>
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/MK3eW3As.jpg" alt="Katherine Johnson" />
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/MK3eW3As.jpg" alt="Katherine Johnson" />
  <img src="https://i.imgur.com/MK3eW3As.jpg" alt="Katherine Johnson" />
</section>
```

### Nesting and organizing components

Components are regular JavaScript functions, so you can keep multiple components in the same file. This is convenient when components are relatively small or tightly related to each other. If this file gets crowded, you can always move `Profile` to a separate file. You will learn how to do this shortly on the [page about imports](https://beta.reactjs.org/learn/importing-and-exporting-components).

Because the `Profile` components are rendered inside `Gallery`—even several times!—we can say that `Gallery` is a **parent component,** rendering each `Profile` as a “child”. This is part of the magic of React: you can define a component once, and then use it in as many places and as many times as you like.

##### Deep Dive

### Components All the Way Down

## Recap

You’ve just gotten your first taste of React! Let’s recap some key points.

- React lets you create components, **reusable UI elements for your app.**
- In a React app, every piece of UI is a component.
- React components are regular JavaScript functions except:

  1.  Their names always begin with a capital letter.
  2.  They return JSX markup.

### Export the component

This sandbox doesn’t work because the root component is not exported:

function Profile() {
return (
<img
      src="https://i.imgur.com/lICfvbD.jpg"
      alt="Aklilu Lemma"
    />
);
}

Try to fix it yourself before looking at the solution!
